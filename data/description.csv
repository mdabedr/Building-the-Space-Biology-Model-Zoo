"<description> Microgravity alters the immune response to in vitro LPS assault engineered in spaceflight: A multi-omics study Microgravity can facilitate creation of a potent environment for opportunistic infection by augmenting virulence and suppressing the host defense. Presumably, extraterrestrial infection may trigger potentially novel bionetworks different from the terrestrial equivalent, which could only be probed by investigating the host-pathogen relationship with minimum terrestrial bias. Towards this objective, we strategically engineered a cell culture module equipped with a feedback controlled semi-automated platform to expose human endothelial cells to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The assay was carried out in the STS-135 space shuttle, and a concurrent ground study constituted the baseline. Transcriptomic investigation revealed an immune blunting in microgravity; Lbp, MyD88 and MD-2 failed to encode proteins responsible for early LPS uptake. Longer exposure results implied that there was a delayed response, potentially ineffectual in preventing pathogens from opportunistically modulating the infection network. Lack of recruitment of growth factors and a debilitated apoptosome supported this potential explanation. Certain cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-8, surged in response to LPS insult in microgravity. Contrasting expressions of B2M, TIMP-1 and VEGRs suggested impaired pro-survival adaptation and healing mechanisms. The susceptibility of oxidative stress and immune regulation to microgravity compelled further investigation of the respective microRNA modulators such as miR-200a and miR-146b. These miRNAs were expressed differently in response to LPS assaults in different gravitational limits. In conclusion, despite a serious drawback attributed to the small sample size, we delineated some of the important aspects of the extraterrestrial etiology; more comprehensive follow up studies are warranted. Present study though compromised by the small sample size was able to shade lights on several aspects of immunological responses to the endotoxic assault mediated by uG. Implementing the host-pathogen interactions in the spaceflight and subsequently lysing the cells onboard presented the critical distinguishing features of the present study from the past reports. We identified the CCM of Tissue Genesis, Inc., HI as the suitable hardware system to carry out the experiment in the spaceflight. CCM is an automated, feedback controlled module that can concurrently support 24 bioreactors following protocols exclusively programmed for individual bioreactor. For this experiment we use samples EA41, EA 47, EA45, and EA155 that were exposed to LPS for 4 hours. Samples EA123, EA165, EA127, EA126 were exposed to LPS for 8Hrs. Samples EA33, EA 125, EA79 and EA 39 were controls in this experiment. </description>"
"<description> In the present study we analyzed miRNA and mRNA expression profiles in human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) incubated in microgravity condition, simulated by a ground-based Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV) bioreactor. Our results show that 42 miRNAs were differentially expressed in MMG-incubated PBLs compared with 1g-incubated ones. Among these, miR-9-5p, miR-9-3p, miR-155-5p, miR-150-3p, and miR-378-3p were the most dysregulated. To improve the detection of functional miRNA-mRNA pairs we performed gene expression profiles on the same samples assayed for miRNA profiling and we integrated miRNA and mRNA expression data. The functional classification of miRNA-correlated genes evidenced significant enrichments in the biological processes of immune/inflammatory response, signal transduction, regulation of response to stress, regulation of programmed cell death and regulation of cell proliferation. We identified the correlation between miR-9-3p, miR-155-5p, miR-150-3p and miR-378-3p expression with that of genes involved in immune/inflammatory response (eg. IFNG and IL17F), apoptosis (eg. PDCD4 and PTEN) and cell proliferation (eg. NKX3-1 and GADD45A). Experimental assays of cell viability and apoptosis induction validated the results obtained by bioinformatics analyses demonstrating that in human PBLs the exposure to reduced gravitational force increases the frequency of apoptosis and decreases cell proliferation. Gene expression profiling was carried out in MMG-incubated PBLs vs. 1g-incubated PBLs on total RNA extracted from the same PBL samples assayed for miRNA profiling. We used the Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray (Agilent), consisting of ~41.000 (60-mer) oligonucleotide probes, which span conserved exons across the transcripts of the targeted full-length genes. </description>"

"<description> Changes in gravitational force such as that experienced by astronauts during space flight induce a redistribution of fluids from the caudad to the cephalad portion of the body together with an elimination of normal head-to-foot hydrostatic pressure gradients. To assess brain gene profile changes associated with microgravity and fluid shift, a large-scale analysis of mRNA expression levels was performed in the brains of 2 weeks control and hindlimb-unloaded (HU) mice using cDNA microarrays. Although to different extent, all functional categories displayed significantly regulated genes indicating that considerable transcriptomic alterations are induced by HU. Interestingly, the TIC class (transport of small molecules and ions into the cells) had the highest percentage of up-regulated genes, while the most down-regulated genes were those of the JAE class (Cell junction, Adhesion, Extracellular Matrix). TIC genes comprised 16% of those whose expression was altered, including sodium channel, nonvoltage-gated 1 beta (Scnn1b), glutamate receptor (Grin1), voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (Vdac1), calcium channel beta 3 subunit (Cacnb3) and others. The analysis performed by GeneMAPP revealed several altered protein classes and functional pathways such as blood coagulation and immune response, learning and memory, ion channels and cell junction. In particular, data indicate that HU causes an alteration in hemostasis which resolves in a shift toward a more hyper-coagulative state with an increased risk of venous thrombosis. Furthermore, HU treatment seems to impact on key steps of synaptic plasticity and learning processes. We used brains of four control (C1, C2, C3, C4) and four tail-suspended hindlimb-unloaded (E1, E2, E3, E4) mice to ensure statistical relevance of the study. 60 ug of total RNA extracted in TRIzol from each brain was reversed transcribed into labeled cDNAs using fluorescent Cy5 or Cy3-dUTP (Amersham Biosciences, NJ). Differently labeled cDNAs obtained from a pair of biological replicas were co-hybridized overnight at 50C with a microscope slide spotted with ~ 27,000 mouse cDNA sequences produced by the Microarray Core Facility of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the �multiple yellow� design (i.e.: C1C2, C3C4, E1E2, E3E4), described in Iacobas DA, Fan C, Iacobas S et al., Transcriptomic changes in developing kidney exposed to chronic hypoxia.

"<description> The wild type WS plants and the Sku5 mutant plants in the WS background were germinated on ISS or on the ground and the gene expression profiles in roots at 4 days or 8 days were established. The Sku5 gene (AT4G12420) codes for a multi-copper oxidase-like protein SKU5 protein that is involved in directed root tip growth. The Sku5 protein is glycosylated, GPI-anchored and localizes to the plasma membrane and the cell wall. The Sku5 gene is expressed most strongly in expanding tissues. The development of WS and Sku5 plants on orbit differs from that on the ground as demonstrated by the comparison of the gene expression profiles between 4 days old to 8 days old plant in the two environments. However the development of Sku5 mutant plants also differs from WS at either age and in either environment, suggesting the role of the genetic background in these developmental decisions. The 4 days old Sku5 roots in orbit engaged substantially more genes than the 4 days old WS roots in orbit but also more than the 4 days old Sku5 roots on the ground. Overall the 4 days old roots differentially expressed more genes in spaceflight relative to ground than the 8 days old roots of either genotype. Finally, the 4 days old Sku5 roots in orbit differ in 862 genes from the 8 days Sku5 roots in orbit while on the ground there is merely half of the number of genes differentially expressed between the 4 days and 8 days developmental stages of the Sku5 roots. APEX03-2 (Advanced Plant Experiment 03-2) also identified as TAGES-Isa (Transgenic Arabidopsis Gene Expression System—Intracellular Signaling Architecture) was launched on SpaceX mission CRS-5 on 10 January 2015. Dry, sterilized Arabidopsis seeds were planted aseptically on the surface of 10-cm2 solid media plates and remained dormant until removed from cold stowage and exposed to light at the initiation of the experiment on the ISS (International Space Station). The plates were grown in the Vegetable Production System (VPS/Veggie) hardware on the Columbus Module of the ISS with the overhead LED lighting of the VPS. At four or for the second experimental set at eight days, seedlings were harvested by an astronaut into KFT (Kennedy Fixation Tube) containing RNAlater solutions. Upon return to Earth, the harvested material was used to compare the transcriptomes of each genotype and each age using RNAseq technology. The patterns of gene expression was compared between treatments (spaceflight versus ground control) within each genotype of same age or between two ages within same genotype and within same treatment. For 4 day old roots 5-8 roots were combined to serve as one biological replica. For 8 day old roots 2-3 roots were used to form one biological replica. In each case the four biological replicas were used for the transcriptomic analysis. </description>"
"<description> BACKGROUND: Ionizing radiation (IR) can be extremely harmful for human cells since an improper DNA-damage response (DDR) to IR can contribute to carcinogenesis initiation. Perturbations in DDR pathway can originate from alteration in the functionality of the microRNA-mediated gene regulation, being microRNAs (miRNAs) small noncoding RNA that act as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. In this study we gained insight into the role of miRNAs in the regulation of DDR to IR under microgravity, a condition of weightlessness experienced by astronauts during space missions, which could have a synergistic action on cells, increasing the risk of radiation exposure. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We analyzed miRNA expression profile of human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) incubated for 4 and 24 h in normal gravity (1 g) and in modeled microgravity (MMG) during the repair time after irradiation with 0.2 and 2Gy of gamma-rays. Our results show that MMG alters miRNA expression signature of irradiated PBL by decreasing the number of radio-responsive miRNAs. Moreover, let-7i*, miR-7, miR-7-1*, miR-27a, miR-144, miR-200a, miR-598, miR-650 are deregulated by the combined action of radiation and MMG. Integrated analyses of miRNA and mRNA expression profiles, carried out on PBL of the same donors, identified significant miRNA-mRNA anti-correlations of DDR pathway. Gene Ontology analysis reports that the biological category of Response to DNA damage is enriched when PBL are incubated in 1 g but not in MMG. Moreover, some anti-correlated genes of p53-pathway show a different expression level between 1 g and MMG. Functional validation assays using luciferase reporter constructs confirmed miRNA-mRNA interactions derived from target prediction analyses. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: On the whole, by integrating the transcriptome and microRNome, we provide evidence that modeled microgravity can affects the DNA-damage response to IR in human PBL. Overall Design: Gene expression signature was defined in PBL irradiated with gamma-rays (2.0 Gy) and incubated in modeled microgravity (mmg) and in parallel ground conditions (1g) for 24h. Five independent experiments were performed for each donor to address which mRNAs were regulated on IR stress. The level of each transcript was represented as Log2. </description>"

"<description> The Rodent Research-3 (RR-3) mission was sponsored by the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly and Co. and the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space to study the effectiveness of a potential countermeasure for the loss of muscle and bone mass that occurs during spaceflight. Twenty BALB/c, 12-weeks old female mice (ten controls and ten treated) were flown to the ISS and housed in the Rodent Habitat for 39-42 days. Twenty mice of similar age, sex and strain were used for ground controls housed in identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. Basal controls were housed in standard vivarium cages. Spaceflight, ground controls and basal groups had blood collected, then were euthanized, had one hind limb removed, and finally whole carcasses were stored at -80 C until dissection. All mice in this data set received only the control/sham injection. </description>"

"<description> We developed a mouse model that captures radiation effects on host biology by transplanting unirradiated Trp53 null mammary tissue to sham or irradiated hosts. Gene expression profiles of tumors that arose in irradiated mice are distinct from those that arose in naive hosts. Host irradiation induces a metaprofile consisting of gene modules representing stem cells, cell motility, macrophages and autophagy. Human orthologs of the host irradiation metaprofile discriminated between radiation-preceded and sporadic human thyroid cancers. An irradiated host centroid was strongly associated with estrogen receptor negative breast cancer. When applied to sporadic human breast cancers, the irradiated host metaprofile strongly associated with basal-like and claudin-low breast cancer intrinsic subtypes. Comparing host irradiation in the context of TGFB levels showed that inflammation was robustly associated with claudin-low tumors. The association of the irradiated host metaprofiles with estrogen receptor negative status and claudin-low subtype suggests that host processes similar to those induced by radiation underlie sporadic cancers. Total RNA was extracted from mammary tumors derived from transplantations of non-irradiated p53null mammary fragments into irradiated hosts. We analyized a total of 32 p53null tumors from irradiated wild type mice: 9 from sham-irradiated hosts, and 23 from irradiated hosts. We also analyzed 24 tumors from irradiated TGFb1 heterozygote hosts: 6 from sham-irradiated hosts, and 18 from irradiated hosts. </description>"

Rice calli were selected at different treatment for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain the diff-genes that caused by the microgravity. </description>"

"<description> Densely ionizing radiation is a major component of the space radiation environment and has potentially greater carcinogenic effect compared to sparsely ionizing radiation that is prevalent in the terrestrial environment. It is unknown to what extent the irradiated microenvironment contributes to the differential carcinogenic potential of densely ionizing radiation. To address this gap, 10-week old BALB/c mice were irradiated with 100 cGy sparsely ionizing g-radiation or 10, 30, or 80 cGy of densely ionizing, 350 MeV/amu Si particles and transplanted 3 days later with syngeneic Trp53 null mammary fragments. Tumor appearance was monitored for 600 days. Tumors arising in Si-particle irradiated mice had a shorter median time to appearance, grew faster and were more likely to metastasize. Most tumors arising in sham-irradiated mice were ER-positive, pseudo-glandular and contained both basal keratin 14 and luminal keratin 8/18 cells (designated K14/18), while most tumors arising in irradiated hosts were K8/18 positive (designated K18) and ER negative. Comparison of K18 vs K14/18 tumor expression profiles showed that genes increased in K18 tumors were associated with ERBB2 and KRAS while decreased genes overlapped with those down regulated in metastasis and by loss of E-cadherin. Consistent with this, K18 tumors grew faster than K14/18 tumors and more mice with K18 tumors developed lung metastases compared to mice with K14/18 tumors. However, K18 tumors arising in Si-particle irradiated mice grew even faster and were more metastatic compared to control mice. A K18 Si-irradiated host profile was enriched in genes involved in mammary stem cells, stroma, and Notch signaling. Thus systemic responses to densely ionizing radiation enriches for a ER-negative, K18-positive tumor, whose biology is more aggressive compared to similar tumors arising in non-irradiated hosts. Key Words: ionizing radiation; breast cancer; heavy ion radiation;initiation; promotion 3 different dose of Si were used. Total RNA was extracted from mammary tumors derived from transplantations of non-irradiated p53null mammary fragments into irradiated hosts. We analyzed a total of 45 Trp53-null tumors: 18 from sham-irradiated hosts, 9 from 10 cGy Si-irradiated hosts, 10 from 30 cGy Si-irradiated hosts, and 8 from irradiated hosts. </description>"

"<description> Proper interpretation of RNA sequencing data requires an understanding of assay sensitivity and sources of variability. To this end, the External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC) developed a standard set of 92 poly-adenylated RNA transcripts that are orthogonal to mammalian RNA that can be added to RNA extracts before library generation and sequencing. The presence of these RNA standards at known ratios improves interpretation of RNA sequencing datasets. To test the utility of the ERCC RNA controls, total RNA extracted from mouse livers from the Rodent Research 1 (flight, ground control, basal control and vivarium control groups) and Rodent Research 3 (flight, ground control and basal control groups) missions were sequenced with and without the ERCC control RNA (RR-3 liver samples without ERCC control have been sequenced previously and the dataset is released in the GLDS-137). To allow comparison within and between groups, ERCC Mix 1 or Mix 2 were added to half of the samples from each group, respectively. </description>"
"<description> We address a key baseline question of whether gene expression changes are induced by the orbital environment, and then we ask whether undifferentiated cells, cells presumably lacking the typical gravity response mechanisms, perceive spaceflight. Arabidopsis seedlings and undifferentiated cultured Arabidopsis cells were launched in April, 2010, as part of the BRIC-16 flight experiment on STS-131. Biologically replicated DNA microarray and averaged RNA digital transcript profiling revealed several hundred genes in seedlings and cell cultures that were significantly affected by launch and spaceflight. The response was moderate in seedlings; only a few genes were induced by more than 7-fold, and the overall intrinsic expression level for most differentially expressed genes was low. In contrast, cell cultures displayed a more dramatic response, with dozens of genes showing this level of differential expression, a list comprised primarily of heat shock-related and stress-related genes. This baseline transcriptome profiling of seedlings and cultured cells confirms the fundamental hypothesis that survival of the spaceflight environment requires adaptive changes that are both governed and displayed by alterations in gene expression. The comparison of intact plants with cultures of undifferentiated cells confirms a second hypothesis: undifferentiated cells can detect spaceflight in the absence of specialized tissue or organized developmental structures known to detect gravity. </description>"

"<description> Age plays a crucial role in the interplay between tumor and host; with further perturbations induced by irradiation. Proton irradiation on tumors induces biological modulations including inhibition of angiogenic and immune factors critical to ''hallmark'' processes impacting tumor development, in addition to physical targeting advantages. These advantages have provided promising results for proton therapy in cancer. Additionally, protons have implications for carcinogenesis risk of space travel (due to the high proportion of high energy protons in space radiation). Through a systems biology approach, we investigated how host tissue (i.e. splenic tissue) of tumor-bearing mice is altered with age, with or without whole-body proton exposure. Transcriptome analysis was performed on splenic tissue from adolescent (68 day) versus old (736 day) C57BL/6 male mice injected with Lewis lung carcinoma cells with or without three fractionations of 0.5Gy (1GeV) proton irradiation. Global transcriptome analysis indicated that proton irradiation of adolescent hosts caused significant signaling changes within splenic tissues that support carcinogenesis within the mice, as compared to old subjects. Increases in cell cycling and immunosuppression in irradiated adolescent hosts with CDK2, MCM7, CD74, and RUVBL2 as the key players were involved in the regulatory changes in host environment response (i.e. spleen). These results suggest a significant biological component to proton irradiation, operative through host age, that would indicate a modulation of host's ability to support carcinogenesis in adolescence and the bestowal of resistance to immunosuppression, carcinogenesis, and genetic perturbation by old age. </description>"

"<description> Spaceflight is a unique environment with profound effects on biological systems including tissue redistribution and musculoskeletal stresses. However, the more subtle biological effects of spaceflight on cells and organisms are difficult to measure in a systematic, unbiased manner. Here we test the utility of the molecularly barcoded yeast deletion collection to provide a quantitative assessment of the effects of microgravity on a model organism. We developed robust hardware to screen, in parallel, the complete collection of ~4800 homozygous and ~5900 heterozygous (including ~1100 single-copy deletions of essential genes) yeast deletion strains, each carrying unique DNA that acts as strain identifiers. We compared strain fitness for the homozygous and heterozygous yeast deletion collections grown in spaceflight and ground, as well as plus and minus hyperosmolar sodium chloride, providing a second additive stressor. The genome-wide sensitivity profiles obtained from these treatments were then queried for their similarity to a compendium of drugs whose effects on the yeast collection have been previously reported. We found that the effects of spaceflight have high concordance with the effects of DNA-damaging agents and changes in redox state, suggesting mechanisms by which spaceflight may negatively affect cell fitness. </description>"
"<description> The Space Algae Experiment Verification Test completed a competitive growth selection on mutagenized microalgae in a series of batch cultures that were passaged for three growth cycles. The experiment was conducted with ground control conditions similar to those actually used in spaceflight. Cultures were limited in growth rate due to gas permeable membranes to provide oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange and a lack of agitation to mix the cells throughout the liquid media. Two strains were grown and three biological replicates were completed for each strain. Specific variables (factors) tested were: 1) The effect of UVC (short-wave ultraviolet light) mutagenesis was tested by sampling the algae cultures prior to mutagenesis. 2) The sensitivity of different strains was tested by conducting the experiment with a wild-type and cell wall mutant (cw15) strain. 3) The effect of competitive growth was tested by sampling each biological replicate experiment at the end of each growth cycle. 4) The effect of live culture storage in the dark was tested by sampling each growth cycle twice. At the time of passage, a sample of cells was pelleted and frozen. The cultures were then stored in the dark in a Cargo Transport Bag (CTB) to simulate storage on the ISS and return of cultures. This factor tested whether cultures could be stored alive in the dark or if samples needed to be fixed at the time of passage in order to get an accurate representation of the genetic variation in each cycle of growth. Paired-end, whole genome sequencing was completed for 38 samples: 2 strains pre mutagenesis and 2 strains X 3 biological replicates X 3 growth cycles X 2 storage conditions. </description>"
"<description> Cesium-137 is a radionuclide of concern in fallout from reactor accidents or nuclear detonations. When ingested or inhaled, it can expose the entire body for an extended period of time, potentially contributing to serious health consequences ranging from acute radiation syndrome to increased cancer risks. In order to identify changes in gene expression that may be informative for detecting such exposure, and to begin examining the molecular responses involved, we have profiled global gene expression in mice injected with 137CsCl. We extracted RNA from the blood of control or 137CsCl-injected mice at 2, 3, 5, 20 or 30 days after exposure. Gene expression was measured using Agilent Whole Mouse Genome Microarrays, and the data was analyzed using BRB-ArrayTools. Three-month old male C57Bl/6 mice were injected intraperitoneally with 8.0 ± 0.3 MBq 137CsCl solution in a volume of 50 μL, or left as controls.

"<description> Plants exhibit a robust transcriptional response to gamma radiation which includes the induction of transcripts required for homologous recombination and the suppression of transcripts that promote cell cycle progression. Various DNA damaging agents induce different spectra of DNA damage as well as collateral damage to other cellular components and therefore are not expected to provoke identical responses by the cell. Here we study the effects of two different types of ionizing radiation (IR) treatment, HZE (1 GeV Fe26+ high mass, high charge, and high energy relativistic particles) and gamma photons, on the transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. Both types of IR induce small clusters of radicals that can result in the formation of double strand breaks (DSBs), but HZE also produces linear arrays of extremely clustered damage. We performed these experiments across a range of time points (1.5-24 h after irradiation) in both wild-type plants and in mutants defective in the DSB-sensing protein kinase ATM. The two types of IR exhibit a shared double strand break-repair-related damage response, although they differ slightly in the timing, degree, and ATM-dependence of the response. The ATM-dependent, DNA metabolism-related transcripts of the DSB response were also induced by other DNA damaging agents, but were not induced by conventional stresses. Both Gamma and HZE irradiation induced, at 24 h post-irradiation, ATM-dependent transcripts associated with a variety of conventional stresses; these were overrepresented for pathogen response, rather than DNA metabolism. In contrast, only HZE-irradiated plants, at 1.5 h after irradiation, exhibited an additional and very extensive transcriptional response, shared with plants experiencing extended night. This response was not apparent in gamma-irradiated plants. We treated 5-day-old WT and atm-1 seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana with 100 Gy of Gamma radiation (over a span of 15 minutes) or 30 Gy of HZE (over a span of approximately 12 minutes). Gamma irradiations were completed at 8:40 am, while HZE irradiations were conducted in two runs (due to space limitations) which were completed at 1:09 and 1:28pm respectively. Gamma treated seedlings were sampled at 10:10 am, 11:40 am, 2:55 pm, 8:40 pm, and 8:40 am. HZE treated seedlings were sampled at 2:39 pm, 4:09 pm, 7:24 pm, 1:09 am, and 1:09 pm. Un-irradiated WT and atm-1 control seedlings were sampled at 10:45 am on Day #1 and 9:15 am on Day #2. There are a total of 22 experimental or control conditions, with two replicates per condition, yielding 44 samples overall. </description>"

"<description> Genome-wide transcriptional profiling showed that reducing gravity levels in the International Space Station (ISS) causes important alterations in Drosophila gene expression intimately linked to imposed spaceflight-related environmental constrains during Drosophila metamorphosis. However, simulation experiments on ground testing space-related environmental constraints, show differential responses. Curiously, although particular genes are not common in the different experiments, the same GO groups including a large multigene family related with behavior, stress response and organogenesis are over represented in them. A global and integrative analysis using the gene expression dynamics inspector (GEDI) self-organizing maps, reveals different degrees in the responses of the transcriptome when using different environmental conditions or microgravity/hypergravity simulation devices. These results suggest that the transcriptome is finely tuned to normal gravity. In regular environmental conditions the alteration of this constant parameter on Earth can have mild effects on gene expression but when environmental conditions are far from optimal, the gene expression is much more intense and consistent effects. </description>"
"<description> Data from the NASA Rodent Research-1 (RR-1) mission showed that gene-expression levels in mouse livers are different depending on what tissue preservation protocol is used and that slow freezing is not an effective method for preserving signals in gene-expression data. In response to these and other observations, the Rapid Freeze hardware was built for use on the International Space Station. The Rapid Freeze hardware freezes mouse tissues (Glovebox freezer) and whole carcasses (Cryochiller) at rates closely mimicking those attained with immersion in liquid nitrogen. Because this hardware will be used extensively on future rodent research missions, it is crucial to understand whether or not it preserves signals in gene expression data in order to maximize the value of these rare and expensive spaceflight experiments. Therefore, this study was designed with three goals: 1) To evaluate the temperature profile of the Cryochiller and Glovebox freezer cartridges (Rapid Freeze hardware) over time during mock on-orbit procedures; 2) To determine the freezing profiles of tissues and carcasses using Rapid Freeze hardware at both optimal and sub-optimal temperatures (to mimic on-orbit operations), compared with those frozen in liquid nitrogen (the laboratory gold standard) or frozen at -80 C (the current standard method); 3) To identify gene expression changes in a) tissues that were frozen via the Glovebox freezer and b) tissues dissected from whole or partial carcasses that were frozen via the Cryochiller versus tissues that were frozen via control methods (liquid nitrogen or -80C slow freeze) to assess how the Rapid Freeze hardware compares with laboratory gold standard practices and our current standard methods. </description>"

"<description> Data from the NASA Rodent Research-1 (RR-1) mission showed that gene-expression levels in mouse livers are different depending on what tissue preservation protocol is used and that slow freezing is not an effective method for preserving signals in gene-expression data.

"<description> This study demonstrates simulated microgravity effects on E. coli K 12 MG1655 when grown on LB medium supplemented with glycerol. The results imply that E. coli readily reprograms itself to combat the multiple stresses imposed due to microgravity. Under these conditions it survives by upregulating oxidative stress protecting genes and simultaneously down regulating the membrane transporters and synthases to maintain cell homeostasis. In this study, a clinostat that mimics microgravity conditions was used to investigate the effects of microgravity on E. coli grown in LB medium supplemented with glycerol to monitor the effects on growth and global gene expression using Affymetrix DNA microarrays. </description>"
"<description> Space radiations and microgravity both could cause DNA damage in cells, but the effects of microgravity on DNA damage response to space radiations are still controversial. A mRNA microarray and microRNA microarray in dauer larvae of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) that endured spaceflight environment and space radiations environment during 16.5-day Shenzhou-8 space mission were performed. In our study, wild type, dys-1 mutant and ced-1 mutant strains of C.elegans endured four conditions during shenzhou-8 spaceflight mission, including spaceflight static condition(ss), spaceflight 1-g centrifugal condition(sc), ground control condition(gc) and no-transport control. Limited to the quantity of worm samples, we performed technical-repeat test but not sample-repeat test.Accordingly, 12 mRNA microarrays were performed. </description>"
"<description> The environmental microbiome study was designed to decipher microbial diversity of the International Space Station surfaces in terms of spatial and temporal distributions using 16S and ITS iTag Illumina sequencing. We hypothesized that the microbial population of environmental surfaces changes in time due to astronautsâ€™ activity and might be location specific. The environmental samples were collected with the polyester wipes from eight different locations in the ISS during two consecutive sampling sessions (three months apart). The specific objective was to unveil the viable microbial diversity of each location during two separate sessions in terms of abundance and richness of the communities. The International Space Station (ISS) as a closed built environment has its own environmental microbiome which is shaped by microgravity, radiation, and limited human presence. The microbial diversity associated with ISS environmental surfaces was investigated during this study. Polyester wipes and contact slides were used for sampling of eight various surface locations on the ISS at different time periods. The samples were retrieved and analyzed immediately upon the return to the Earth (via Soyuz TMA-14M or Dragon capsule from SpaceX). After surface sample collection, contact slides containing nutrient media for the growth of bacteria and fungi were incubated at 25ËšC. The polyester wipes were processed to measure microbial burden (R2A, Blood Agar, and Potato Dextrose Agar) and recover cultivable bacteria as well as fungi. Subsequently, viable microbial burden was assessed using Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) assay, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods after propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment. The 16S-tag and metagenome analyses were used to elucidate viable microbial diversity. The cultivable bacterial population yield from the polyester wipes was very high (5 to 7-logs) when compared with the contact slides (102 to 103 CFU/m2). The PMA-qPCR analysis showed considerable variation of viable bacterial population (105 to 109 16S rDNA gene copies/m2) among locations sampled. Unlike contact slides, polyester wipes cover much larger sample surface (~1 m2) and produce much more reliable results of the microbial diversity of the ISS covering both cultivable and non-cultivable species. The cultivable, total, and viable microbial diversity was determined utilizing state-of-the art molecular techniques. The implementation of the PMA assay before DNA extraction allowed distinguishing viable microorganisms, which is crucial for determining their role to the crew health, the ISS maintenance and the general knowledge of the closed environmentally controlled built systems. </description>"

"<description> Changes in gravitational force such as that experienced by astronauts during space flight induce a redistribution of fluids from the caudad to the cephalad portion of the body together with an elimination of normal head-to-foot hydrostatic pressure gradients. To assess brain gene profile changes associated with microgravity and fluid shift, a large-scale analysis of mRNA expression levels was performed in the brains of 2 weeks control and hindlimb-unloaded (HU) mice using cDNA microarrays. Although to different extent, all functional categories displayed significantly regulated genes indicating that considerable transcriptomic alterations are induced by HU. Interestingly, the TIC class (transport of small molecules and ions into the cells) had the highest percentage of up-regulated genes, while the most down-regulated genes were those of the JAE class (Cell junction, Adhesion, Extracellular Matrix). TIC genes comprised 16% of those whose expression was altered, including sodium channel, nonvoltage-gated 1 beta (Scnn1b), glutamate receptor (Grin1), voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (Vdac1), calcium channel beta 3 subunit (Cacnb3) and others. The analysis performed by GeneMAPP revealed several altered protein classes and functional pathways such as blood coagulation and immune response, learning and memory, ion channels and cell junction. In particular, data indicate that HU causes an alteration in hemostasis which resolves in a shift toward a more hyper-coagulative state with an increased risk of venous thrombosis. Furthermore, HU treatment seems to impact on key steps of synaptic plasticity and learning processes. We used brains of four control (C1, C2, C3, C4) and four tail-suspended hindlimb-unloaded (E1, E2, E3, E4) mice to ensure statistical relevance of the study. 60 ug of total RNA extracted in TRIzol from each brain was reversed transcribed into labeled cDNAs using fluorescent Cy5 or Cy3-dUTP (Amersham Biosciences, NJ). Differently labeled cDNAs obtained from a pair of biological replicas were co-hybridized overnight at 50C with a microscope slide spotted with ~ 27,000 mouse cDNA sequences produced by the Microarray Core Facility of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the �multiple yellow� design (i.e.: C1C2, C3C4, E1E2, E3E4), described in Iacobas DA, Fan C, Iacobas S et al., Transcriptomic changes in developing kidney exposed to chronic hypoxia.

"<description> NASA's Rodent Research (RR) project is playing a critical role in advancing biomedical research on the physiological effects of space environments. Due to the limited resources for conducting biological experiments aboard the International Space Station (ISS), it is imperative to use crew time efficiently while maximizing high-quality science return. NASA's GeneLab project has as its primary objectives to 1) further increase the value of these experiments using a multi-omics, systems biology-based approach, and 2) disseminate these data without restrictions to the scientific community. The current investigation assessed viability of RNA, DNA, and protein extracted from archived RR-1 tissue samples for epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic assays. During the first RR spaceflight experiment, a variety of tissue types were harvested from subjects, snap-frozen or RNAlater-preserved, and then stored at least a year at -80C after return to Earth. They were then prioritized for this investigation based on likelihood of significant scientific value for spaceflight research. All tissues were made available to GeneLab through the bio-specimen sharing program managed by the Ames Life Science Data Archive and included mouse adrenal glands, quadriceps, gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus, soleus, eye, and kidney. We report here protocols for and results of these tissue extractions, and thus, the feasibility and value of these kinds of omics analyses. In addition to providing additional opportunities for investigation of spaceflight effects on the mouse transcriptome and proteome in new kinds of tissues, our results may also be of value to program managers for the prioritization of ISS crew time for rodent research activities. </description>"
"<description> Rodent hind limb unloading was used as a model for reduced muscle activity and eventual atrophy. After a 10 day period of unloading, mice in this study were “reloaded” for 3 days and regained use of their hind limbs. We report the application of Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology for high-throughput profiling of mRNA in soleus muscle of adult (6 mo) and aged (22-24 mo) mice. Our goal was to determine the effects of hind limb unloading and reloading on mRNA profiles in soleus muscle and compare between adult and aged mice. We find that there are distinct response in the profile of fatty acid oxidation, TCA cycle, ETC oxidative phosphorylation gene expression patterns in response to unloading and reloading. The repsonses are generally simialr between young and old mice. </description>"

"<description> Densely ionizing radiation is a major component of the space radiation environment and has potentially greater carcinogenic effect compared to sparsely ionizing radiation that is prevalent in the terrestrial environment. It is unknown to what extent the irradiated microenvironment contributes to the differential carcinogenic potential of densely ionizing radiation. To address this gap, 10-week old BALB/c mice were irradiated with 100 cGy sparsely ionizing g-radiation or 10, 30, or 80 cGy of densely ionizing, 350 MeV/amu Si particles and transplanted 3 days later with syngeneic Trp53 null mammary fragments. Tumor appearance was monitored for 600 days. Tumors arising in Si-particle irradiated mice had a shorter median time to appearance, grew faster and were more likely to metastasize. Most tumors arising in sham-irradiated mice were ER-positive, pseudo-glandular and contained both basal keratin 14 and luminal keratin 8/18 cells (designated K14/18), while most tumors arising in irradiated hosts were K8/18 positive (designated K18) and ER negative. Comparison of K18 vs K14/18 tumor expression profiles showed that genes increased in K18 tumors were associated with ERBB2 and KRAS while decreased genes overlapped with those down regulated in metastasis and by loss of E-cadherin. Consistent with this, K18 tumors grew faster than K14/18 tumors and more mice with K18 tumors developed lung metastases compared to mice with K14/18 tumors. However, K18 tumors arising in Si-particle irradiated mice grew even faster and were more metastatic compared to control mice. A K18 Si-irradiated host profile was enriched in genes involved in mammary stem cells, stroma, and Notch signaling. Thus systemic responses to densely ionizing radiation enriches for a ER-negative, K18-positive tumor, whose biology is more aggressive compared to similar tumors arising in non-irradiated hosts. Key Words: ionizing radiation; breast cancer; heavy ion radiation;initiation; promotion 3 different dose of Si were used. Total RNA was extracted from mammary tumors derived from transplantations of non-irradiated p53null mammary fragments into irradiated hosts. We analyzed a total of 45 Trp53-null tumors: 18 from sham-irradiated hosts, 9 from 10 cGy Si-irradiated hosts, 10 from 30 cGy Si-irradiated hosts, and 8 from irradiated hosts. </description>"
"<description> Transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFbeta) is a tumor suppressor during the initial stage of tumorigenesis, but it can switch to a tumor promoter during neoplastic progression. Ionizing radiation (IR), both a carcinogen and a therapeutic agent, induces TGFbeta activation in vivo. We now show that IR sensitizes human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) to undergo TGFbeta-mediated epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Non-malignant HMEC (MCF10A, HMT3522 S1 and 184v) were irradiated with 2 Gy shortly after attachment in monolayer culture, or treated with a low concentration of TGFbeta (0.4 ng/ml), or double-treated. All double-treated (IR+TGFbeta) HMEC underwent a morphological shift from cuboidal to spindle-shaped. This phenotype was accompanied by decreased expression of epithelial markers E-cadherin, beta-catenin and ZO-1, remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, and increased expression of mesenchymal markers N-cadherin, fibronectin and vimentin. Furthermore, double-treatment increased cell motility, promoted invasion and disrupted acinar morphogenesis of cells subsequently plated in Matrigel. Neither radiation nor TGFbeta alone elicited EMT, even though IR increased chronic TGFbeta signaling and activity. Gene expression profiling revealed that double treated cells exhibit a specific 10-gene signature associated with Erk/MAPK signaling. We hypothesized that IR-induced MAPK activation primes non-malignant HMEC to undergo TGFbeta-mediated EMT. Consistent with this, Erk phosphorylation were transiently induced by irradiation, persisted in irradiated cells treated with TGFbeta, and treatment with U0126, a Mek inhibitor, blocked the EMT phenotype. Together, these data demonstrate that the interactions between radiation-induced signaling pathways elicit heritable phenotypes that could contribute to neoplastic progression. Experiment Overall Design: Nonmalignant human mammary epithelial MCF10A cells (passages 106 and 108) were seeded at cloning density in 35mm dishes (10^5 cells/dish). Cell culture medium consisted of 3ml/dish of MGEM serum free medium (Cambrex Inc.), supplemented or not with 400pg/ml recombinant Transforming Growth Factor-beta. Cells were irradiated or not 5h post plating using 160 KV X-ray with a total dose of 2Gy. Sham, IR-treated, TGFbeta-treated and double-treated (IR+TGFbeta) MCF10A cells were harvested 8 days post-IR. Briefly, cells were washed with PBS, denatured in Trizol, scraped off the dish and subjected to chloroform extraction. After centrifugation, the upper phase was precipitated with an equal volume of isopropanol. RNA precipitates were resuspended in RNase free water and further purified on RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Germany). RNA quality was assessed on an Agilent Bio-Analyzer. The dataset analyzed by microarray included biological duplicates for each treatment in two independent experiments and three sham treated samples. Microarray data were generated at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Molecular Profiling Laboratory (http://hta.lbl.gov) using a high-throughput, automated GeneChip system (Affymetrix). Briefly, target preparation, HT_HG-U133A array plate hybridization setup, washing and staining were performed on an Affymetrix robotic system (GCAS) using version 2.1 protocols. Scanning (protocol version 2.2.09) was performed on a CCD-based high throughput scanner (Affymetrix). Samples were analyzed and clustered with the (UNO) One Color GenetrafficTM software version 3.2-12 (Iobion Informatics LLC, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Genes whose expression was specifically altered by treatment were defined as those in which dye ratio was more than 1.75-fold (mean log2ratio>0.8) from baseline in at least three out of the four treated samples compared to the three sham samples. Significance analysis tests (p<0.05) were performed using Excel between sham samples and either IR, TGFbeta or TGFbeta+IR samples. </description>"
"<description> Bystander mechanisms that originate in the areas surrounding a tissue damage presumably play an important role participating in wound healing and tissue remodeling. Thus, identification and characterization of bystander mechanisms will help to development of new treatments of patients with a radiation exposure. In the present study, we irradiated 3-dimensional tissue model of human epidermis, Epi-200 (Mat-Tek, Ashland, MA), with 2.5 Gy protons. By exposing only a thin strip across the center of the EPI-200 tissue, we have been able to measure global gene expression responses in directly irradiated and bystander cells located at 0.125-0.375, 0.375-0.625, 0.625-875 mm from the irradiation line. The data were analyzed using BRB-Array Tools (NIH), and further gene ontology analysis and network analysis was performed with Panther (Applied Biosystems) and IPA (Ingenuity), accordingly. Significantly responding genes were identified at all distances and included sets common to both direct and bystander responses. False discovery rate in bystander samples did not exceed 20% (p=0.001) and was sufficiently low in the samples obtained after the whole tissue exposure (0.06-1.16%). Analysis of the fragments cut at the same distance revealed 52, 54 and 88 differentially expressed genes. These gene lists overlapped each other had from 3 to 12 genes in common including CLED2, S100A7A. Samples obtained after the whole tissue exposure discovered 949 differentially expressed genes. Moreover, the performed gene ontology analysis showed there overrepresentation of TP53 pathway (pathways, p=2.04E-02), a common marker of direct irradiation response, and also overrepresentation of the following groups of genes: signal transduction (p=4.52E-04), cell communication (p=1.24E-04) and cell cycle in the category of biological processes; DNA helicase activity (p=2.54E-07), receptor binding (p=6.19E-04), calcium ion binding proteins (p=2.57E-03) as the molecular functions. Differentially expresses genes of bystander samples had few categories in common such as cell communication (p=2.36E-03) and signal transduction (p=2.42E-03) among the biological processes and receptor activity (p=4.54E-03) among the molecular functions. Categories specific for the bystander samples included G-protein coupled receptors (p=7.24E-03) and ligand-gated ion channels (p=4.16E-03) suggesting a role of external stimulation and ion trafficking in bystander mechanisms. Radiation induced gene expression in 3-dimensional tissue model, Epi-200, was measured in 16 hours after exposure to 2.5 Gy of protons. Four independent experiments were performed for the samples collected at different distances from the irradiation line (125-375, 375-625 and 625-875 micrometers) using three tissue fragments per a data point. Moreover, three sets of whole tissue irradited samples were also generated for 0 and 2.5 Gy (6 samples total) and used for comparison of bystander and direct responses. </description>"

"<description> The objective of the Rodent Research-5 (RR-5) study was to evaluate bone loss in mice during spaceflight and to determine if treatment with a modified version of NEL-like molecule-1 (NELL-1) can reduce or prevent bone loss that would otherwise occur during spaceflight. To this end, a cohort of forty 30-weeks-old female BALB/cAnNTac mice were flown to the ISS and housed in the Rodent Habitat. Six days after launch half of the mice were treated with NELL-1 (10 mg/kg in 0.3 ml PBS), while the other half were treated with vehicle control (0.3 mls PBS). Fourteen days after launch animals were again treated with NELL-1 or vehicle control as before, except that all animals were also injected with the bone marker, calcein green (20 mg/kg in 0.1 ml). Injections of vehicle, NELL-1, and bone markers were intraperitoneal. After all forty mice on orbit received two treatments; ten control mice and ten experimental mice were randomly selected for live animal return (LAR). At approximately 30 days after launch the twenty LAR mice were transported live back to Earth. Animals were allowed to recover for 30 days in standard habitats before euthanasia via intraperitoneal injection with ketamine/xylazine. During the recovery, the animals received another two treatments. GeneLab received RNA later preserved dorsal skin from ten live animal return and ten matching ground control mice. These were from the vehicle control animals only. RNA was extracted, libraries generated (stranded, ribodepleted) and sequenced (target 60 M clusters at PE 150 bp). </description>"
"<description> Microgravity leads to a 10-15% loss of bone mass in astronauts during space flight. Osteoclast is the multinucleated bone resorbing cell. In this study, we used NASA developed ground based Rotary Wall Vessel Bioreactor (RWV), Rotary Cell Culture System (RCCS) to simulate microgravity (uXg) conditions and demonstrated a significant increase (2-fold) in osteoclastogenesis compared to ground based control (Xg) mouse bone marrow cultures. We further determined the gene expression profiling of RAW 264.7 osteoclast progenitor cells in microgravity by agilent microarray analysis. Gene expression pattern was functional group clustered by transcriptome analysis using gene ontology tree machine (GOTM) for cell proliferation/survival, differentiation and function. We confirm the microgravity modulated gene expression critical for osteoclast differentiation by real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis in murine bone marrow cultures. We identify transcription factors such as c-Jun, c-Fos, PU-1 critical for osteoclast differentiation is up-regulated in microgravity conditions. In addition, microgravity resulted in 2.3 and 2.0-fold increase in the level of cathepsin K and MMP-9 matrix metalloproteinase expression in preosteoclast cells involved in the bone resorption process respectively. We also demonstrate a significant increase in the expression levels of M-CSF receptor, c-Fms and PLCy2 and S100A8 molecules that play an important role in Ca2+ signaling essential for osteoclast function. Further, microgravity stimulated preosteoclast cells showed elevated cytosolic Ca2+ levels compared to ground based control cells. Thus, microgravity regulated gene expression profiling in preosteoclast cells provide new insights in to molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets of osteoclast differentiation/activation responsible for bone loss and fracture risk in astronauts during space flight mission. Microgravity associated with space flight is a challenge for normal bone homeostasis. Astronauts experience 10-15% bone loss during a space flight mission. We aimed to determine the effect of simulated microgravity on osteoclast preosteoclasts cells. RAW264.7 cells (1.5 x 106 /ml) were loaded in RCCS with DMEM containing 10% FBS for 24 h. The cells were stimulated with RANKL (80ng/ml) for 24 h to obtain preosteoclasts in parallel with ground based control cells. Total RNA was isolated using RNAzol reagent (Biotecx Labs, Houston, TX) from control (Xg) and microgravity (uXg) subjected cells and hybridized with Agilent whole mouse genome 4x44K array system. Slides were washed and scanned on an Agilent G2565 microarray scanner. Data obtained were analyzed with Agilent feature extraction and GeneSpring GX v7.3.1 software packages (Genus biosystem, Inc.

"<description> A combination therapy of electromagnetic fields (EMF) and simulated microgravity (SMG) has not been examined in regenerative medicine of cartilage. In the present study, a bioreactor system using extremely low-frequency EMF and SMG was applied during the chondrogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). It was hypothesized that a beneficial effect of EMF regarding chondrogenesis (COL2A) could be combined with an avoiding effect of SMG regarding hypertrophy (COLXA1) of cartilage. Pellet cultures of hMSCs formed cartilaginous tissue under the addition of growth factors (FGF; TGF-beta3). Pure SMG reduced COLXA1 expression but also COL2A expression of hMSCs. Pure EMF showed no gene expression changes of hMSCs during chondrogenic differentiation. Combining EMF/SMG resulted in a re-increase of COL2A but did not reach control levels. The COL2A to COLXA1 ratio of combined EMF/SMG was not significantly different from control levels.

"<description> Age plays a crucial role in the interplay between tumor and host; with further perturbations induced by irradiation. Proton irradiation on tumors induces biological modulations including inhibition of angiogenic and immune factors critical to ''hallmark'' processes impacting tumor development, in addition to physical targeting advantages. These advantages have provided promising results for proton therapy in cancer. Additionally, protons have implications for carcinogenesis risk of space travel (due to the high proportion of high energy protons in space radiation). Through a systems biology approach, we investigated how host tissue (i.e. splenic tissue) of tumor-bearing mice is altered with age, with or without whole-body proton exposure. Transcriptome analysis was performed on splenic tissue from adolescent (68 day) versus old (736 day) C57BL/6 male mice injected with Lewis lung carcinoma cells with or without three fractionations of 0.5Gy (1GeV) proton irradiation. Global transcriptome analysis indicated that proton irradiation of adolescent hosts caused significant signaling changes within splenic tissues that support carcinogenesis within the mice, as compared to old subjects. Increases in cell cycling and immunosuppression in irradiated adolescent hosts with CDK2, MCM7, CD74, and RUVBL2 as the key players were involved in the regulatory changes in host environment response (i.e. spleen). These results suggest a significant biological component to proton irradiation, operative through host age, that would indicate a modulation of host's ability to support carcinogenesis in adolescence and the bestowal of resistance to immunosuppression, carcinogenesis, and genetic perturbation by old age. </description>"
"<description> The ability to grow safe, fresh food to supplement packaged foods of astronauts in space has been an important goal for NASA. Food crops grown in space experience different environmental conditions than plants grown on Earth (e.g., reduced gravity, elevated radiation levels). To study the effects of space conditions, red romaine lettuce, Lactuca sativa cv ‘Outredgeous,’ plants were grown in Veggie plant growth chambers on the International Space Station (ISS) and compared with ground-grown plants. Multiple plantings were grown on ISS and harvested using either a single, final harvest, or sequential harvests in which several mature leaves were removed from the plants at weekly intervals. Ground controls were grown simultaneously with a 24–72 h delay using ISS environmental data. Food safety of the plants was determined by heterotrophic plate counts for bacteria and fungi, as well as isolate identification using samples taken from the leaves and roots. Molecular characterization was conducted using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) to provide taxonomic composition and phylogenetic structure of the community. Leaves were also analyzed for elemental composition, as well as levels of phenolics, anthocyanins, and Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC). Comparison of flight and ground tissues showed some differences in total counts for bacteria and yeast/molds (2.14 – 4.86 log10 CFU/g), while screening for select human pathogens yielded negative results. Bacterial and fungal isolate identification and community characterization indicated variation in the diversity of genera between leaf and root tissue with diversity being higher in root tissue, and included differences in the dominant genera. The only difference between ground and flight experiments was seen in the third experiment, VEG-03A, with significant differences in the genera from leaf tissue. Flight and ground tissue showed differences in Fe, K, Na, P, S, and Zn content and total phenolic levels, but no differences in anthocyanin and ORAC levels. This study indicated that leafy vegetable crops can produce safe, edible, fresh food to supplement to the astronauts’ diet, and provide baseline data for continual operation of the Veggie plant growth units on ISS. </description>"
"<description> Age plays a major role in tumor incidence and is an important consideration when modeling the carcinogenesis process or estimating cancer risks. Epidemiological data show that from adolescence through middle age, cancer incidence increases with age. This effect is commonly attributed to a lifetime accumulation of cellular, particularly DNA, damage. However, during middle-age, the incidence begins to decelerate and, for many tumor sites, it actually decreases at sufficiently advanced ages. We investigated if the observed deceleration and potential decrease in incidence could be attributed to a decreased capacity of older hosts to support tumor progression, and whether HZE (high atomic number (Z), high energy (E)) radiation differentially modulates tumor progression in young versus middle-age hosts, issues relevant to estimating carcinogenesis risk for astronauts. Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells were injected into syngeneic mice (143 and 551 days old), which were then subject to whole-body 56Fe irradiation (1GeV/amu). Three findings emerged: 1) among unirradiated animals, substantial inhibition of tumor progression and significantly decreased tumor growth rates were seen for middle-aged mice compared to young mice; 2) whole-body 56Fe irradiation (1GeV/amu) inhibited tumor progression in both young and in middle-aged mice (with greater suppression seen in case of young animals), with little effect on tumor growth rates; and 3) 56Fe irradiation (1GeV/amu) suppressed tumor progression in young mice, to a degree not significantly different than transiting from young to middle-aged. Thus, 56Fe irradiation (1GeV/amu) acted similar to aging with respect to tumor progression. We further investigated the molecular underpinnings driving the radiation modulation of tumor dynamics in young and middle-aged mice. Through global gene expression analysis, the key players, FASN, AKT1, and the CXCL12/CXCR4 complex, were determined to be contributory. In sum, these findings demonstrate a reduced capacity of middle-aged hosts to support the progression phase of carcinogenesis and identify molecular factors contributory to HZE radiation modulation of tumor progression as a function of age. For genome-wide expression profiling of tumor tissue, Mouse WG-6 BeadArray chips (Illumina, San Diego, CA) were used. Total RNA was amplified with the Ambion Illumina TotalPrep Amplification Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) and labeled from all replicate biological samples for each condition. The number of tumor sample replicates used from each condition is as follows: 10 samples from young unirradiated mice, 8 samples from young irradiated mice, 7 samples from middle-aged unirradiated mice, 5 samples from middle-aged irradiated mice. Total RNA was isolated and purified using Trizol (Invitrogen) or RNeasy (Qiagen), quantified and qualified using Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent) and samples were deemed suitable for amplification and hybridization if they had O.D. 260/280 = 1.7 - 2.1, 28s/18s = 2:1, RIN (RNA integrity number) >7. Total RNA of 500ng per sample was amplified using Ambion TotalPrep (Ambion), and 1.5ug of the product was loaded onto the chips. Following hybridization at 55C, the chips were washed and then scanned using the Illumina iScan (Illumina), and the data were analyzed using GenomeStudio (Illumina). Data were first analyzed for gene expression and then culled for present genes (genes that meet the criteria of detection p-value < 0.05). Expression above background was included in an expressed genes working data set for further analyses. Rank variant normalization was applied to the data before extensive analysis. Differential gene expression analysis was used to compare to the reference group, young unirradiated mice, and genes were then evaluated and validated. </description>"
"<description> Astronauts are exposed to a unique combination of stressors during spaceflight, which leads to alterations in their physiology and potentially increases their susceptibility to infectious pathogens. Here we report the first microarray evaluation of any astronaut tissue sample, specifically whole blood, before and after spaceflight using an array comprising 234 well-characterized stress response genes. Differentially regulated genes included those important for DNA repair, oxidative stress, and protein folding/degradation. Microarrays comprising 234 well characterized stress-related genes were used to profile transcriptomic changes in six astronauts before and after short-duration spaceflight. Blood samples were collected for analysis from each eastronaut 10 days prior and 2-3 hours after return from spaceflight. Data submitted for platform GPL140 contain genes that have been pre-filtered by the analytical software to remove values of low certainty, resulting in missing values for some samples. Unfortunately, these original data are no longer available due to physical damage at Tulane University during hurricane Katrina, but the processed values were retained in redundant locations and these are submitted for upload to GEO. </description>"
"<description> Changes in the physical environment modulate cell responses and may lead to the impairment or even failure of tissue function as a result of mechanotransduction processes. It has been suggested that this situation occurs in some age-related diseases and some pathological conditions observed in space, such as cardiovascular deconditioning, bone loss, muscle atrophy, and impaired immune responses. All of these are associated with endothelial dysfunction but the precise mechanism is still unclear. We used the microarray approach to obtain insights into the mechanism responsible for endothelial dysfunction by taking advantage of the challenging environment of gravitational unloading onboard the International Space Station. The effects of gravitational unloading on HUVEC gene expression were investigated by means of cDNA microarray analyses of six randomly chosen samples (three for each of the two conditions of spaceflight and 1g) using Affymetrix Gene Human 1.0 ST Arrays </description>"
"<description> In recent times, long-term stay has become a common occurrence in the International Space Station (ISS). However, adaptation to the space environment can sometimes pose physiological problems to the astronauts after their return. Therefore, it is important to develop healthcare technologies for astronauts. In this study, hair, an easy-to-obtain sample, was identified as the candidate. In order to investigate the genetic changes in human hair during space flight, the hair follicles of 10 astronauts were analyzed by DNA microarray and real time q-PCR analyses. Space environment induced gene expression of hair follicles of astronaut was measured 6 differnent times included 2 in flight on orbit. Ten independent experiments were performed on differing astronauts. and the sampling day was differed for each astronaut because of their schedules. </description>"
"<description> Accumulating data support the concept that ionizing radiation therapy (RT) has the potential to convert the tumor into an in situ, individualized vaccine; however this potential is rarely realized by RT alone. Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) is an immunosuppressive cytokine that is activated by RT and inhibits the antigen-presenting function of dendritic cells and the differentiation of effector CD8+ T cells. Here we tested the hypothesis that TGFβ hinders the ability of RT to promote anti-tumor immunity. Development of tumor-specific immunity was examined in a pre-clinical model of metastatic breast cancer. Mice bearing established 4T1 mouse mammary carcinoma treated with pan-isoform specific TGFβ neutralizing antibody, 1D11, showed significantly improved control of the irradiated tumor and non-irradiated metastases, but no effect in the absence of RT. Notably, whole tumor transcriptional analysis demonstrated the selective upregulation of genes associated with immune-mediated rejection only in tumors of mice treated with RT+TGFβ blockade. Mice treated with RT+TGFβ blockade exhibited cross-priming of CD8+ T cells producing IFNγ in response to three tumor-specific antigens in tumor-draining lymph nodes, which was not evident for single modality treatment. Analysis of the immune infiltrate in mouse tumors showed a significant increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells only in mice treated with the combination of RT+TGFβ blockade. Depletion of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells abrogated the therapeutic benefit of RT+TGFβ blockade. These data identify TGFβ as a master inhibitor of the ability of RT to generate an in situ tumor vaccine, which supports testing inhibition of TGFβ during radiotherapy to promote therapeutically effective anti-tumor immunity. We used genome-wide microarray to depict main biological processes responsibles for the therapeutic benefit of the combination ofTGF-beta blockade and local radiotherapy. To gain a more comprehensice protrait of the effects of RT and TGFbeta blockade on gene expressionin tumors, we collected 4T1 tumors 4 days after completion of RT. Three tumors from each group were then subjected to RNA extraction and hybridization on affymetrix array. </description>"
"<description> With extended stays aboard the International Space Station (ISS) becoming commonplace, there is a need to better understand the effects of microgravity on cardiac function. We utilized human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) to study the effects of microgravity on cell-level cardiac function and gene expression. The hiPSC-CMs were cultured aboard the ISS for 5.5 weeks and their gene expression, structure, and functions were compared to ground control hiPSC-CMs. Exposure to microgravity on the ISS caused alterations in hiPSC-CM calcium handling. RNA-sequencing analysis demonstrated 2,635 genes were differentially expressed among flight, post-flight, and ground control samples, including genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism. This study represents the first use of hiPSCs to model the effects of spaceflight on human cardiomyocyte structure and function. </description>"
"<description> The vestibular system receives a permanent influence from gravity and reflexively controls equilibrium. If we assume gravity has remained constant during the species' evolution, will its sensory system adapt to abrupt loss of that force? We address this question in the land snail Helix lucorum exposed to 30 days of near weightlessness aboard the Bion-M1 satellite, and studied geotactic behavior of postflight snails, differential gene expressions in statocyst transcriptome, and electrophysiological responses of mechanoreceptors to applied tilts. Each approach revealed plastic changes in the snail's vestibular system assumed in response to spaceflight. Absence of light during the mission also affected statocyst physiology, as revealed by comparison to dark-conditioned control groups. Readaptation to normal tilt responses occurred at ~20 h following return to Earth. Despite the permanence of gravity, the snail responded in a compensatory manner to its loss and readapted once gravity was restored. </description>"
"<description> On Earth plants are constantly exposed to a gravitational field of 1G. Gravity affects a plant in every step of its development. Germinating seedlings orient their radicle and hypocotyl and growing plants position organs at a specific Gravitropic Set-point Angle dictated by the asymmetric distribution of auxin depending on the gravity vector. Hence gravitropism is one of the fundamental growth responses in plants. For any experiment studying the effects of gravity on plants, the ultimate control is the microgravity in space. In this study, Arabidopsis seeds were flown to the International Space Station and allowed to germinate and grow for 3 days in microgravity. Arabidopsis Wild Type Col-0 seeds were plated onto twenty-two 60mm Petri plates, loaded into PDFUs and inserted 4 Biological Research in Canisters (BRICs). Approximately 800 seeds were sterilized, plated on each 60mm Petri plates and cold stratified for 16 hours followed by 2 hours of white light treatment. The BRICs were maintained at 4C until spaceflight to ensure seed germination in microgravity. After 3 days of germination and growth, the seedlings were fixed by injecting RNAlater into the chamber. They were kept at ambient temperature for 12 hours followed by freezing at -80C. An additional 22 plates were used as ground controls. After the spaceflight, tissue from five plates was pooled to make each of three replicates. Both membrane and soluble proteins were extracted from the pooled seedlings. Proteins were trypsin digested, labelled with iTRAQ and identified using tandem mass spectrometry. </description>"

"<description> The Cosmic Ray Exposure Sequencing Science (CRESS) payload system is a proof of concept experiment to assess the genomic impact of space radiation on seeds. CRESS was designed as a secondary payload for the December 2016 high-altitude, high-latitude, and long-duration balloon flight carrying the Boron And Carbon Cosmic Rays in the Upper Stratosphere (BACCUS) experimental hardware. Investigation of the biological effects of Galactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR), particularly those of ions with High-Z and Energy (HZE), is of interest due to the genomic damage this type of radiation inflicts. The biological effects of upper-stratospheric mixed radiation above Antarctica (ANT) were sampled using Arabidopsis thaliana seeds and were compared to those resulting from a controlled simulation of GCR at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) and to laboratory control seed. The payload developed for Antarctica exposure was broadly designed to 1U CubeSat specifications (10cmx10cmx10cm, <1.33kg), maintained 1 atm internal pressure, and carried an internal cargo of four seed trays (about 580,000 seeds) and twelve CR-39 Solid-State Nuclear Track Detectors (SSNTDs). The irradiated seeds were recovered, sterilized and grown on Petri plates for phenotypic screening. BNL and ANT M0 seeds showed significantly reduced germination rates and elevated somatic mutation rates when compared to non-irradiated controls, with the BNL mutation rate also being significantly higher than that of ANT. Genomic DNA from mutants of interest was evaluated with whole-genome sequencing using PacBio SMRT technology. Sequence data revealed the presence of an array of genome structural variants in the genomes of M0 and M1 mutant plants. </description>"
"<description> The objective of the Rodent Research-5 (RR-5) study was to evaluate bone loss in mice during spaceflight and to determine if treatment with a modified version of NEL-like molecule-1 (NELL-1) can reduce or prevent bone loss that would otherwise occur during spaceflight. To this end, a cohort of forty 30-weeks-old female BALB/cAnNTac mice were flown to the ISS and housed in the Rodent Habitat. Six days after launch half of the mice were treated with NELL-1 (10 mg/kg in 0.3 ml PBS), while the other half were treated with vehicle control (0.3 mls PBS). Fourteen days after launch animals were again treated with NELL-1 or vehicle control as before, except that all animals were also injected with the bone marker, calcein green (20 mg/kg in 0.1 ml). Injections of vehicle, NELL-1, and bone markers were intraperitoneal. After all forty mice on orbit received two treatments; ten control mice and ten experimental mice were randomly selected for live animal return (LAR). At approximately 30 days after launch the twenty LAR mice were transported live back to Earth. Animals were allowed to recover for 30 days in standard habitats before euthanasia via intraperitoneal injection with ketamine/xylazine. During the recovery, the animals received another two treatments. GeneLab received RNA later preserved dorsal skin from ten live animal return and ten matching ground control mice. These were from the vehicle control animals only. RNA was extracted, libraries generated (stranded, ribodepleted) and sequenced (target 60 M clusters at PE 150 bp). </description>"
"<description> Bystander mechanisms that originate in the areas surrounding a tissue damage presumably play an important role participating in wound healing and tissue remodeling. Thus, identification and characterization of bystander mechanisms will help to development of new treatments of patients with a radiation exposure. In the present study, we irradiated 3-dimensional tissue model of human epidermis, Epi-200 (Mat-Tek, Ashland, MA), with 2.5 Gy protons. By exposing only a thin strip across the center of the EPI-200 tissue, we have been able to measure global gene expression responses in directly irradiated and bystander cells located at 0.125-0.375, 0.375-0.625, 0.625-875 mm from the irradiation line. The data were analyzed using BRB-Array Tools (NIH), and further gene ontology analysis and network analysis was performed with Panther (Applied Biosystems) and IPA (Ingenuity), accordingly. Significantly responding genes were identified at all distances and included sets common to both direct and bystander responses. False discovery rate in bystander samples did not exceed 20% (p=0.001) and was sufficiently low in the samples obtained after the whole tissue exposure (0.06-1.16%). Analysis of the fragments cut at the same distance revealed 52, 54 and 88 differentially expressed genes. These gene lists overlapped each other had from 3 to 12 genes in common including CLED2, S100A7A. Samples obtained after the whole tissue exposure discovered 949 differentially expressed genes. Moreover, the performed gene ontology analysis showed there overrepresentation of TP53 pathway (pathways, p=2.04E-02), a common marker of direct irradiation response, and also overrepresentation of the following groups of genes: signal transduction (p=4.52E-04), cell communication (p=1.24E-04) and cell cycle in the category of biological processes; DNA helicase activity (p=2.54E-07), receptor binding (p=6.19E-04), calcium ion binding proteins (p=2.57E-03) as the molecular functions. Differentially expresses genes of bystander samples had few categories in common such as cell communication (p=2.36E-03) and signal transduction (p=2.42E-03) among the biological processes and receptor activity (p=4.54E-03) among the molecular functions. Categories specific for the bystander samples included G-protein coupled receptors (p=7.24E-03) and ligand-gated ion channels (p=4.16E-03) suggesting a role of external stimulation and ion trafficking in bystander mechanisms. Radiation induced gene expression in 3-dimensional tissue model, Epi-200, was measured in 16 hours after exposure to 2.5 Gy of protons. Four independent experiments were performed for the samples collected at different distances from the irradiation line (125-375, 375-625 and 625-875 micrometers) using three tissue fragments per a data point. Moreover, three sets of whole tissue irradited samples were also generated for 0 and 2.5 Gy (6 samples total) and used for comparison of bystander and direct responses. </description>"
"<description> To further develop our gene expression approach to biodosimetry, we have employed whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to identify genes with the potential to distinguish radiation dose across an exposure range relevant for medical decision-making in a radiological emergency. Human peripheral blood from healthy donors was irradiated ex vivo, and a 74-gene consensus signature was identified that distinguished between four radiation doses (0.5, 2, 5 and 8 Gy) and control samples. The same set of genes separated samples by exposure level at both six and 24 hours after treatment, with overlap evident only at the highest two doses (5 and 8 Gy). Expression of five genes (CDKN1A, FDXR, SESN1, BBC3 and PHPT1) from this signature was quantified in the same RNA samples by real-time PCR, confirming low variability between donors as well as the predicted radiation response pattern. Experiment Overall Design: Radiation induced gene expression in human blood was measured at 6 and 24 hours after exposure to doses of 0, 0.5, 2, 5 and 8 Gy g-rays. Five independent experiments were performed at each time (6 or 24 hours) using different donors for each experiment </description>"

"<description> R. rubrum S1H inoculated on solid minimal media was sent to the ISS in September 2006 (BASE-A experiment). After 10 days flight, R. rubrum cultures returned back to Earth. These cultures were then subjected to both transcriptomic and proteomic analysis and compared with the corresponding ground control. Whole-genome oligonucleotide microarray and high throughput proteomics, which offer the possibility to survey respectively the global transcriptional and translational response of an organism, were used to test the effect of space flight. Moreover, in an effort to identify a specific stress response of R. rubrum to space flight, ground simulation of space ionizing radiation and space gravity were performed under identical culture setup and growth conditions encountered during the actual space journey. This study is unique in combining the results from an actual space experiment with the corresponding space ionizing radiation and modeled microgravity ground simulations, which lead to a more solid dissection of the different factors contribution acting in space flight conditions. Total RNA was extracted from R. rubrum S1H grown after 10 days in space flight or after 10 days in simulated ionizing radiation or simulated microgravity.

"<description> The ability to grow safe, fresh food to supplement packaged foods of astronauts in space has been an important goal for NASA. Food crops grown in space experience different environmental conditions than plants grown on Earth (e.g., reduced gravity, elevated radiation levels). To study the effects of space conditions, red romaine lettuce, Lactuca sativa cv ‘Outredgeous,’ plants were grown in Veggie plant growth chambers on the International Space Station (ISS) and compared with ground-grown plants. Multiple plantings were grown on ISS and harvested using either a single, final harvest, or sequential harvests in which several mature leaves were removed from the plants at weekly intervals. Ground controls were grown simultaneously with a 24–72 h delay using ISS environmental data. Food safety of the plants was determined by heterotrophic plate counts for bacteria and fungi, as well as isolate identification using samples taken from the leaves and roots. Molecular characterization was conducted using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) to provide taxonomic composition and phylogenetic structure of the community. Leaves were also analyzed for elemental composition, as well as levels of phenolics, anthocyanins, and Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC). Comparison of flight and ground tissues showed some differences in total counts for bacteria and yeast/molds (2.14 – 4.86 log10 CFU/g), while screening for select human pathogens yielded negative results. Bacterial and fungal isolate identification and community characterization indicated variation in the diversity of genera between leaf and root tissue with diversity being higher in root tissue, and included differences in the dominant genera. The only difference between ground and flight experiments was seen in the third experiment, VEG-03A, with significant differences in the genera from leaf tissue. Flight and ground tissue showed differences in Fe, K, Na, P, S, and Zn content and total phenolic levels, but no differences in anthocyanin and ORAC levels. This study indicated that leafy vegetable crops can produce safe, edible, fresh food to supplement to the astronauts’ diet, and provide baseline data for continual operation of the Veggie plant growth units on ISS. </description>"
"<description> Microbes interact with humans in complex ways and understanding how they respond to the spaceflight environment is important to the success of future manned spaceflight missions. The BRIC-23 mission was designed to measure the response of Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus to the spaceflight environment. This experiment aimed to produce high quality omics data from B. subtilis and S. aureus grown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) to allow comparison to matched ground controls. There were two primary objectives for this experiment: (1) Demonstrate all post-flight processes and operations required for successful completion of GeneLab Reference Missions conducted on ISS, and (2) Generate high quality GeneLab Reference Mission omics data sets for two prokaryotic model organisms, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. Freezing Control Experiment: The BRIC hardware has significant thermal inertia, thus the freezing rate of samples placed at -80 C is quite slow. This could affect RNA-sequencing, proteomic and metabolic data sets. In an effort to understand how slow freezing could affect these data sets, a control experiment was designed in which B. subtilis and S. aureus were grown in petri plates and either slow frozen to -80 C at a rate matching the BRIC-23 spaceflight samples or processed immediately to harvest RNA and protein. B.subtilis omics data is deposited in GLDS-138. </description>"
"<description> The JAXA MHU-2 mission had two objectives: 1) To increase understanding of effects of spaceflight on the gut environment (microbiota and metabolites) and immune system, using multi-omics based analysis; 2) To evaluate whether fructo-oligosaccharides added to the diet as prebiotics improve the gut environment and immune function during spaceflight. Twelve 16-18 week old male C57BL/6J mice were singly housed in the JAXA Habitat Cage Units (HCUs) on the ISS for 30 days. Six flight mice were housed in microgravity, while six were exposed to simulated 1g by centrifugation. These two flight groups were further divided in half so that three mice in each group received standard JAXA chow, while the other three were fed chow supplemented with fructooligosaccharides (FOS). Mice were returned live and euthanized and dissected <1 day after splashdown. Ground controls (n=6) were asynchronous and housed in HCUs. Vivarium controls (n=6) were asynchronous and housed in standard habitats. Three ground control and three vivarium animals received standard chow, while the other three each ground control and vivarium animals received FOS-supplemented chow. Ground and vivarium samples were dissected by a separate dissection team than flight samples. Femoral skin was dissected 30 minutes after euthanasia and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen.

"<description> In this study transcriptome profiling was used to gain insight into the spaceflight adaptation role of Altered response to gravity-1 (Arg1), a gene known to affect gravity responses in plants on Earth. The study compared expression profiles of cultured lines of Arabidopsis thaliana derived from wild type (WT) cultivar Col-0 to profiles from a knock-out line deficient in the gene encoding (ARG1 KO), both on the ground and in space. The cell lines were launched on SpaceX CRS-2 as part of the Cellular Expression Logic (CEL) experiment of the BRIC17 spaceflight mission. The cultured cell lines were grown within 60mm Petri plates in Petri Dish Fixation Units (PDFUs) that were housed within the Biological Research In Canisters (BRIC) hardware. Spaceflight samples were fixed on orbit. Differentially expressed genes were identified between the two environments (spaceflight and comparable ground controls) and the two genotypes (WT and ARG1 KO). Each genotype engaged unique genes during physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment, with little overlap. Most of the genes altered in expression in spaceflight in WT cells were found to be Arg1-dependent, suggesting a major role for that gene in the physiological adaptation of undifferentiated cells to spaceflight. </description>"
"<description> Space travel is associated with continuous low-dose-rate exposure to high Linear Energy Transfer (LET) radiation. Pathophysiological manifestations after low-dose radiation exposure are strongly influenced by non-cytocidal radiation effects including microbiome and cellular gene expression. Using a mouse model for exposure to high LET radiation, we observed substantial changes in the composition and functional potential of the microbiome. These were paralleled by changes in the abundance of multiple metabolites, which were related to the enzymatic activity of the altered metagenome by means of metabolic network modeling. There was a complex dynamic in microbial and metabolic composition at different radiation doses, suggestive of transient, dose-dependent interactions between microbial ecology and signals from the host's cellular damage repair processes. Functional shifts included features associated with dysbiosis at the onset of chronic inflammatory responses, which could prMouse fecal microbiome after exposure to high LET radiatione-dispose space travelers to systemic, long-term health risks. </description>"

"<description> Interplanetary human spaceflight represents a formidable medical challenge, but also provides a unique platform for investigating human adaptation to extreme environmental changes. Understanding the long-term effects of isolation has relevance in a range of scenarios and it is well recognized that a better understanding of the relationship between environmental exposure and the epigenome can lead to more effective preventive measures. Here we conduct a longitudinal epigenetic, mood state and biochemical profiling of 6 crew members in an experiment simulating a 520-day mission to Mars. Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles. Firstly, we found that long-term isolation can induce global DNA methylation remodeling, and this change seems to be an active adaptation (rather than a random process or a by-product of the isolation). This study is the first to demonstrate the dynamic relationship between global epigenetic remodeling and isolation-induced mood state and biochemical changes. Secondly, by considering the location of methylation sites within the genome and using gene-pathway annotation, we were able to identify pathways that were significantly enriched in methylation events and consider their association with specific function and the timeline of the mission. Thirdly, via our definition of epi-entropy, a measure of entropy adapted to methylation events, we observed that the methylation remodeling produced a marked reduction in epi-entropy. Results suggest that DNA methylation change is an indicator of change rather than its by-product, i.e., there is a psychology-epigenome-metabolism model of long-term depression; DNA methylation programs the environment signal into the epigenome, which is subsequently transformed into the biochemical output and health outcome. Thus, longitudinal epigenetic profiling could code the effect of isolation and act as early indicators of latent health outcome. A longitudinal epigenetic, mood state and biochemical profiling of 6 crew members in an experiment simulating a 520-day mission to Mars. 36 samples of blood cell DNA methylation profiling were obtained by Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, across 6 sampling points during the 520 days mission for all of the 6 crew members. </description>"
"<description> To reveal outcomes of microgravity on molecular processes within the cellular environment we have employed a mass-spectrometry based proteomics approach. Proteomics analysis based on mass spectrometry allows for the relative quantitation of a large number of proteins concurrently, and in a relatively unbiased manner. Mass spectrometry based proteomics can be rendered even more informative by addition of a labeling component to understand the dynamics of the changing protein content. In this study, we utilized a combination of proteomics techniques, namely label-free quantification and dynamic stable-isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (Dynamic SILAC) to characterize the microgravity stress response in primary cardiomyocytes. </description>"

"<description> In the present study we analyzed miRNA and mRNA expression profiles in human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) incubated in microgravity condition, simulated by a ground-based Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV) bioreactor. Our results show that 42 miRNAs were differentially expressed in MMG-incubated PBLs compared with 1g-incubated ones. Among these, miR-9-5p, miR-9-3p, miR-155-5p, miR-150-3p, and miR-378-3p were the most dysregulated. To improve the detection of functional miRNA-mRNA pairs we performed gene expression profiles on the same samples assayed for miRNA profiling and we integrated miRNA and mRNA expression data. The functional classification of miRNA-correlated genes evidenced significant enrichments in the biological processes of immune/inflammatory response, signal transduction, regulation of response to stress, regulation of programmed cell death and regulation of cell proliferation. We identified the correlation between miR-9-3p, miR-155-5p, miR-150-3p and miR-378-3p expression with that of genes involved in immune/inflammatory response (eg. IFNG and IL17F), apoptosis (eg. PDCD4 and PTEN) and cell proliferation (eg. NKX3-1 and GADD45A). Experimental assays of cell viability and apoptosis induction validated the results obtained by bioinformatics analyses demonstrating that in human PBLs the exposure to reduced gravitational force increases the frequency of apoptosis and decreases cell proliferation. Gene expression profiling was carried out in MMG-incubated PBLs vs. 1g-incubated PBLs on total RNA extracted from the same PBL samples assayed for miRNA profiling. We used the Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray (Agilent), consisting of ~41.000 (60-mer) oligonucleotide probes, which span conserved exons across the transcripts of the targeted full-length genes. </description>"
"<description> To understand the molecular mechanisms affected by spaceflight, it is essential to achieve high quality sample preservation on-orbit for downstream gene expression analysis. However, sample preservation protocols must also be compatible with available equipment and crew time. NASA's Rodent Research (RR) missions have used various methods for euthanasia, carcass preservation, and tissue preservation. This study extends the sample preservation study performed by GeneLab in GLDS-49 which examined conditions used for the RR-1 mission to include conditions used for multiple RR missions and is designed to help determine factors which may confound data analysis. To determine whether these various factors affect changes in gene expression, this ground-based study generated gene expression profiles measured by RNAseq from the livers of 20-21 week-old female C57BL/6J mice. Multiple, interacting factors were investigated: 1) To understand how euthanasia protocols affect gene expression when mouse carcasses are slow frozen, mice were euthanized by either euthasol injection, ketamine/xylazine injection, or CO2 inhalation, and carcasses slow frozen on dry-ice mimicking carcass preservation in the MELFI on the ISS. Carcasses were thawed and RNA extracted from livers; 2) To understand how carcass preservation protocols affect gene expression, mice were euthanized with euthasol and carcasses preserved by flash freezing in liquid nitrogen, slow freezing on dry ice, or immersion in RNAlater following three-way segmentation. Carcasses were thawed and RNA extracted from livers; 3) To understand how tissue preservation protocols affect gene expression, mice were euthanized with euthasol and livers dissected and processed immediately, or preserved by flash freezing in liquid nitrogen, slow freezing on dry ice, or immersion in RNAlater. Liver samples that were processed immediately were homogenized in RLT buffer and then either immediately further processed for RNA extraction or were stored for 70 days at -80C post-homogenization in sample RLT buffer prior to RNA extraction. </description>"
"<description> Entire microRNA expression were analyzed using the Filgen Array miRNA Caenorhabditis elegans 232 probes (Filgen).

"<description> To realistically evaluate the effects of the environment in space, it is necessary to understand the effects of external factors during sample transport from Earth to space. The present study focused on temperature, profiling the altered gene expression that develops under low cultivation temperatures in C. elegans, used as a space life science model. The 7903 genes were selected as differentially expressed genes, and divided into five sets with similar expression patterns using k-means clustering. Results from Gene Ontology analysis are significantly indicated that the cell cycle related genes, and the TGF?/insulin-like signal pathway related genes changed. The TGF?/insulin-like signal pathway is expected to be activated due to low temperatures, as well as by other stressors. To determine the genes whose expression changed four thermal conditions (10, 15, 20, and 25 ¡C), DNA microarray analysis was performed. The data consisted of 12 samples, consisting of three biological replicates at each temperature. </description>"
<description> The microbial composition of the International Space Station (ISS) environment is of critical interest due to potential impact of its constituents on human health and operational mission success. This study examined the whole metagenome of ISS microbes at both a species- and gene-level resolution. Air filter and dust samples from the ISS were analyzed and compared to samples collected in a terrestrial cleanroom environment. Samples were collected from ISS and cleanroom environments and treated to examine DNA from total versus viable populations. Microbial genes relevant to human health such as antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes were quantified. </description>
"<description> Genome-wide transcriptional profiling shows that reducing gravity levels in the International Space Station (ISS) causes important alterations in Drosophila gene expression. However, simulation experiments on ground, without space constraints, show weaker effects than space environment. A global and integrative analysis using the gene expression dynamics inspector (GEDI) self-organizing maps, reveals a subtle response of the transcriptome using different populations and microgravity and hypergravity simulation devices. These results suggest that, in addition to behavioural responses that can be detected also at the gene expression level, the transcriptome is finely tuned to normal gravity. The alteration of this constant parameter on Earth can have effects on gene expression that depends both on the environmental conditions and the ground based facility used to compensate the gravity vector. Alternative and commons effects of mechanical facilities, like the Random Positioning Machine and a centrifuge, and strong magnetic field ones, like a cryogenically cooled superconductive magnet, are discussed. We compare the effects over the gene expression profile of different gender/age Drosophila imagoes in 3-4 days-long experiments under altered gravity conditions into three GBF (Ground Based Facilities for micro/hyper- gravity simulation) using whole genome microarray platforms. Descriptions of different GBFs (treatments): LDC means Large Diameter Centrifuge. Samples can be placed under three conditions: inside LDC (at certain g level), at the LDC rotational control and at external 1g control (outside the LDC). RPM means Random Positioning Machine. Samples can be placed under two conditions: inside RPM (at nearly 0g, Microgravity level) and at external 1g control (outside the RPM). At the magnet, means INSIDE the Magnetic levitator (another GBF). Samples can be placed under four conditions: inside Magnet 0g* (at microgravity with magnetic field), inside Magnet at 1g* (internal control with magnetic field) or inside the magnet 2g* (at hypergravity with magnetic field) and at external 1g control (outside the magnet) </description>"
"<description> Aspergillus fumigatus is a saprophytic, filamentous fungus that is ubiquitous outdoors (soil, decaying vegetation) and indoors (hospitals, simulated closed habitats, etc.). A. fumigatus can adapt to various environmental conditions and form airborne conidia that are the inoculum for a variety of diseases (e.g. non- and invasive pulmonary infections, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, etc.) in immunocompromised hosts. In an on-going Microbial Observatory Experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) molecular phylogeny of several fungal isolates were characterized. Two strains, ISSF 21 and IF1SW-F4, were isolated from the HEPA filter and the surface of the Cupola of the ISS, respectively. Using primers targeting the internal transcribed spacers ITS1 and 2, both isolates were identified as A. fumigatus. The whole genome sequence analysis of ISSF 21 revealed increased number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) when compared to the reference A. fumigatus 293. Knowing that A. fumigatus is an opportunistic pathogen and microgravity highly influences the antibiotic susceptibility and pathogenicity of microorganisms, we examined pathogenicity of both ISS isolates using the zebrafish larval model. The space station isolates (ISSF-021 and IF1SW-F4) were more virulent than two clinical strains (Af293 and CEA10) whose pathogenicity was highly characterized. Here the whole genome sequences of ISSF-021 strain are being deposited. </description>"
"<description> In recent times, long-term stay has become a common occurrence in the International Space Station (ISS). However, adaptation to the space environment can sometimes pose physiological problems to the astronauts after their return. Therefore, it is important to develop healthcare technologies for astronauts. In this study, hair, an easy-to-obtain sample, was identified as the candidate. In order to investigate the genetic changes in human hair during space flight, the hair follicles of 10 astronauts were analyzed by DNA microarray and real time q-PCR analyses. Space environment induced gene expression of hair follicles of astronaut was measured 6 differnent times included 2 in flight on orbit. Ten independent experiments were performed on differing astronauts. and the sampling day was differed for each astronaut because of their schedules. </description>"

"<description> The purpose of this study was to evaluate transcriptional changes in mouse spleens using a ground-based model for spaceflight. This model includes prolonged unloading and low-dose irradiation. Low-dose-rate gamma-radiation was delivered to 6-month old female C57BL/6J mice using 57Co plates (0.04 Gy) to simulate the radiation environment of spaceflight. Anti-orthostatic tail suspension was used to model the unloading, fluid shift, and physiological stress aspects of the microgravity component of spaceflight. Mice were hindlimb suspended and/or irradiated for 21 days. Mice were euthanized and spleens collected 7 days following treatment. RNA sequencing data was generated to assess transcriptional changes in these spleens. </description>"

"<description> Astronauts have been previously shown to exhibit decreased salivary lysozyme and increased dental calculus and gingival inflammation in response to space flight, host factors that could contribute to oral diseases such as caries and periodontitis. However, the specific physiological response of caries-causing bacteria such as Streptococcus mutans to space flight and/or ground-based simulated microgravity has not been extensively investigated. In this study, High Aspect Ratio Vessel (HARV) S. mutans simulated microgravity and normal gravity cultures were assessed for changes in metabolite and transcriptome profiles, H2O2 resistance, and competence in sucrose-containing biofilm media. Stationary phase S. mutans simulated microgravity cultures displayed increased killing by H2O2 compared to normal gravity control cultures, but competence was not affected. RNA-seq analysis revealed that expression of 153 genes was up-regulated >= 2-fold and 94 genes down-regulated >= 2-fold during simulated microgravity HARV growth. These included a number of genes located on extrachromosomal elements, as well as genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, translation, and stress responses. Collectively, these results suggest that growth under microgravity analog conditions promotes changes in S. mutans gene expression and physiology that may translate to an altered cariogenic potential of this organism during space flight missions. Overall design: Differential gene expression was compared between RNA from S. mutans grown in normal gravity HARVs (n=3 independent cultures) and RNA from S. mutans grown in simulated microgravity HARVs (n=3 independent cultures) </description>"
"<description> The Rodent Research-3 (RR-3) mission was sponsored by the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly and Co. and the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space to study the effectiveness of a potential countermeasure for the loss of muscle and bone mass that occurs during spaceflight. Twenty BALB/c, 12-weeks old female mice (ten controls and ten treated) were flown to the ISS and housed in the Rodent Habitat for 39-42 days. Twenty mice of similar age, sex and strain were used for ground controls housed in identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. Basal controls were housed in standard vivarium cages. Spaceflight, ground controls and basal groups had blood collected, then were euthanized, had one hind limb removed, and finally whole carcasses were stored at -80 C until dissection. All mice in this data set received only the control/sham injection. </description>"

"<description> Data from the NASA Rodent Research-1 (RR-1) mission showed that gene-expression levels in mouse livers are different depending on what tissue preservation protocol is used and that slow freezing is not an effective method for preserving signals in gene-expression data. In response to these and other observations, the Rapid Freeze hardware was built for use on the International Space Station. The Rapid Freeze hardware freezes mouse tissues (Glovebox freezer) and whole carcasses (Cryochiller) at rates closely mimicking those attained with immersion in liquid nitrogen. Because this hardware will be used extensively on future rodent research missions, it is crucial to understand whether or not it preserves signals in gene expression data in order to maximize the value of these rare and expensive spaceflight experiments. Therefore, this study was designed with three goals: 1) To evaluate the temperature profile of the Cryochiller and Glovebox freezer cartridges (Rapid Freeze hardware) over time during mock on-orbit procedures; 2) To determine the freezing profiles of tissues and carcasses using Rapid Freeze hardware at both optimal and sub-optimal temperatures (to mimic on-orbit operations), compared with those frozen in liquid nitrogen (the laboratory gold standard) or frozen in at -80 C (the current standard method); 3) To identify gene expression changes in a) tissues that were frozen via the Glovebox freezer and b) tissues dissected from whole or partial carcasses that were frozen via the Cryochiller versus tissues that were frozen via control methods (liquid nitrogen or -80C slow freeze) to assess how the Rapid Freeze hardware compares with laboratory gold standard practices and our current standard methods. </description>"
"<description> Microgravity leads to a 10-15% loss of bone mass in astronauts during space flight. Osteoclast is the multinucleated bone resorbing cell. In this study, we used NASA developed ground based Rotary Wall Vessel Bioreactor (RWV), Rotary Cell Culture System (RCCS) to simulate microgravity (uXg) conditions and demonstrated a significant increase (2-fold) in osteoclastogenesis compared to ground based control (Xg) mouse bone marrow cultures. We further determined the gene expression profiling of RAW 264.7 osteoclast progenitor cells in microgravity by agilent microarray analysis. Gene expression pattern was functional group clustered by transcriptome analysis using gene ontology tree machine (GOTM) for cell proliferation/survival, differentiation and function. We confirm the microgravity modulated gene expression critical for osteoclast differentiation by real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis in murine bone marrow cultures. We identify transcription factors such as c-Jun, c-Fos, PU-1 critical for osteoclast differentiation is up-regulated in microgravity conditions. In addition, microgravity resulted in 2.3 and 2.0-fold increase in the level of cathepsin K and MMP-9 matrix metalloproteinase expression in preosteoclast cells involved in the bone resorption process respectively. We also demonstrate a significant increase in the expression levels of M-CSF receptor, c-Fms and PLCy2 and S100A8 molecules that play an important role in Ca2+ signaling essential for osteoclast function. Further, microgravity stimulated preosteoclast cells showed elevated cytosolic Ca2+ levels compared to ground based control cells. Thus, microgravity regulated gene expression profiling in preosteoclast cells provide new insights in to molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets of osteoclast differentiation/activation responsible for bone loss and fracture risk in astronauts during space flight mission. Microgravity associated with space flight is a challenge for normal bone homeostasis. Astronauts experience 10-15% bone loss during a space flight mission. We aimed to determine the effect of simulated microgravity on osteoclast preosteoclasts cells. RAW264.7 cells (1.5 x 106 /ml) were loaded in RCCS with DMEM containing 10% FBS for 24 h. The cells were stimulated with RANKL (80ng/ml) for 24 h to obtain preosteoclasts in parallel with ground based control cells. Total RNA was isolated using RNAzol reagent (Biotecx Labs, Houston, TX) from control (Xg) and microgravity (uXg) subjected cells and hybridized with Agilent whole mouse genome 4x44K array system. Slides were washed and scanned on an Agilent G2565 microarray scanner. Data obtained were analyzed with Agilent feature extraction and GeneSpring GX v7.3.1 software packages (Genus biosystem, Inc.

"<description> Spaceflight is a unique environment with profound effects on biological systems including tissue redistribution and musculoskeletal stresses. However, the more subtle biological effects of spaceflight on cells and organisms are difficult to measure in a systematic, unbiased manner. Here we test the utility of the molecularly barcoded yeast deletion collection to provide a quantitative assessment of the effects of microgravity on a model organism. We developed robust hardware to screen, in parallel, the complete collection of ~4800 homozygous and ~5900 heterozygous (including ~1100 single-copy deletions of essential genes) yeast deletion strains, each carrying unique DNA that acts as strain identifiers. We compared strain fitness for the homozygous and heterozygous yeast deletion collections grown in spaceflight and ground, as well as plus and minus hyperosmolar sodium chloride, providing a second additive stressor. The genome-wide sensitivity profiles obtained from these treatments were then queried for their similarity to a compendium of drugs whose effects on the yeast collection have been previously reported. We found that the effects of spaceflight have high concordance with the effects of DNA-damaging agents and changes in redox state, suggesting mechanisms by which spaceflight may negatively affect cell fitness. </description>"

"<description> In the present study we analyzed miRNA and mRNA expression profiles in human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) incubated in microgravity condition, simulated by a ground-based Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV) bioreactor. Our results show that 42 miRNAs were differentially expressed in MMG-incubated PBLs compared with 1g-incubated ones. Among these, miR-9-5p, miR-9-3p, miR-155-5p, miR-150-3p, and miR-378-3p were the most dysregulated. To improve the detection of functional miRNA-mRNA pairs we performed gene expression profiles on the same samples assayed for miRNA profiling and we integrated miRNA and mRNA expression data. The functional classification of miRNA-correlated genes evidenced significant enrichments in the biological processes of immune/inflammatory response, signal transduction, regulation of response to stress, regulation of programmed cell death and regulation of cell proliferation. We identified the correlation between miR-9-3p, miR-155-5p, miR-150-3p and miR-378-3p expression with that of genes involved in immune/inflammatory response (eg. IFNG and IL17F), apoptosis (eg. PDCD4 and PTEN) and cell proliferation (eg. NKX3-1 and GADD45A). Experimental assays of cell viability and apoptosis induction validated the results obtained by bioinformatics analyses demonstrating that in human PBLs the exposure to reduced gravitational force increases the frequency of apoptosis and decreases cell proliferation. Gene expression profiling was carried out in MMG-incubated PBLs vs. 1g-incubated PBLs on total RNA extracted from the same PBL samples assayed for miRNA profiling. We used the Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray (Agilent), consisting of ~41.000 (60-mer) oligonucleotide probes, which span conserved exons across the transcripts of the targeted full-length genes. </description>"
"<description> With extended stays aboard the International Space Station (ISS) becoming commonplace, there is a need to better understand the effects of microgravity on cardiac function. We utilized human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) to study the effects of microgravity on cell-level cardiac function and gene expression. The hiPSC-CMs were cultured aboard the ISS for 5.5 weeks and their gene expression, structure, and functions were compared to ground control hiPSC-CMs. Exposure to microgravity on the ISS caused alterations in hiPSC-CM calcium handling. RNA-sequencing analysis demonstrated 2,635 genes were differentially expressed among flight, post-flight, and ground control samples, including genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism. This study represents the first use of hiPSCs to model the effects of spaceflight on human cardiomyocyte structure and function. </description>"
"<description> This is a genome-wide approach to identifying genes persistently induced in the mouse mammary gland by acute whole body low dose ionizing radiation (10cGy), 1 and 4 weeks after exposure. Gene expression that is modified under these parameters were compared between Tgfb1 wild type and heterozygote littermates in order to determine which genes induced or repressed by radiation were mediated via Tgfb1 status. Differential gene expression was analyzed in Tgfb1 heterozygote and wild type littermate 4th mammary glands, after whole body exposure to an acute dose of 10cGy ionizing radiation. Estrus cycle was normalized in all mice two days prior to irradiation by injection with an estrogen and progesterone mixture. It is widely believed that the carcinogenic action of ionizing radiation is due to targeted DNA damage and resulting mutations, but there is also substantial evidence that non-targeted radiation effects alter epithelial phenotype and the stromal microenvironment. Activation of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFbeta) is a non-targeted radiation effect that mediates cell fate decisions following DNA damage and regulates microenvironment composition; it could either suppress or promote cancer. Gene expression profiling shown herein demonstrates that low dose radiation (10 cGy) elicits persistent changes in Tgfb1 wild type and heterozygote murine mammary gland that are highly modulated by TGFbeta. We asked if such non-targeted radiation effects contribute to carcinogenesis by using a novel radiation chimera model. Unirradiated Trp53 null mammary epithelium was transplanted to the mammary stroma of mice previously exposed to a single low (10 -100 cGy) radiation dose. By 300 days, 100% of transplants in irradiated hosts at either 10 or 100 cGy had developed Trp53 null breast carcinomas compared to 54% in unirradiated hosts. Tumor growth rate was also increased by high, but not low, dose host irradiation. In contrast, irradiation of Tgfb1 heterozygote mice prior to transplantation failed to decrease tumor latency, or increase growth rate at any dose. Host irradiation significantly reduced the latency of invasive ductal carcinoma compared to spindle cell carcinoma, as well as those tumors negative for smooth muscle actin in wild type but not Tgfb1 heterozygote mice. However, irradiation of either host genotype significantly increased the frequency of estrogen receptor negative tumors. These data demonstrate two concepts critical to understanding radiation risks. First, non-targeted radiation effects can significantly promote the frequency and alter the features of epithelial cancer. Second, radiation-induced TGFbeta activity is a key mechanism of tumor promotion. Keywords: Differential gene expression after low dose irradiation Two genotypes: TGBbeta1 heterozygote and wildtype mouse mammary glands. Two time points post-10cGy-irradiation per genotype (1 week, 4 weeks); control time point was 1 week post-sham-irradiation. Two or three replicates per time point. </description>"
"<description> The JAXA MHU-2 mission had two objectives: 1) To increase understanding of effects of spaceflight on the gut environment (microbiota and metabolites) and immune system, using multi-omics based analysis; 2) To evaluate whether fructo-oligosaccharides added to the diet as prebiotics improve the gut environment and immune function during spaceflight. Twelve 16-18 week old male C57BL/6J mice were singly housed in the JAXA Habitat Cage Units (HCUs) on the ISS for 30 days. Six flight mice were housed in microgravity, while six were exposed to simulated 1g by centrifugation. These two flight groups were further divided in half so that three mice in each group received standard JAXA chow, while the other three were fed chow supplemented with fructooligosaccharides (FOS). Mice were returned live and euthanized and dissected <1 day after splashdown. Ground controls (n=6) were asynchronous and housed in HCUs. Vivarium controls (n=6) were asynchronous and housed in standard habitats. Three ground control and three vivarium animals received standard chow, while the other three each ground control and vivarium animals received FOS-supplemented chow.

"<description> Changes in the physical environment modulate cell responses and may lead to the impairment or even failure of tissue function as a result of mechanotransduction processes. It has been suggested that this situation occurs in some age-related diseases and some pathological conditions observed in space, such as cardiovascular deconditioning, bone loss, muscle atrophy, and impaired immune responses. All of these are associated with endothelial dysfunction but the precise mechanism is still unclear. We used the microarray approach to obtain insights into the mechanism responsible for endothelial dysfunction by taking advantage of the challenging environment of gravitational unloading onboard the International Space Station.

"<description> Presented here is the environmental microbiome study of the International Space Station surfaces. The environmental samples were collected with the polyester wipes from eight different locations in the ISS during two consecutive sampling sessions (three months apart). The specific objective was to unveil the pool of genes for each location during two separate sessions to learn of functional and metabolic diversity of microorganisms in the ISS. The International Space Station (ISS) as a closed built environment has its own environmental microbiome which is shaped by microgravity, radiation, and limited human presence. The microbial diversity associated with ISS environmental surfaces was investigated during this study. Polyester wipes and contact slides were used for sampling of eight various surface locations on the ISS at different time periods. The samples were retrieved and analyzed immediately upon the return to the Earth (via Soyuz TMA-14M or Dragon capsule from SpaceX). After surface sample collection, contact slides containing nutrient media for the growth of bacteria and fungi were incubated at 25C. The polyester wipes were processed to measure microbial burden (R2A, Blood Agar, and Potato Dextrose Agar) and recover cultivable bacteria as well as fungi. Subsequently, viable microbial burden was assessed using Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) assay, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods after propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment. The 16S-tag and metagenome analyses were used to elucidate viable microbial diversity. The cultivable bacterial population yield from the polyester wipes was very high (5 to 7-logs) when compared with the contact slides (10^2 to 10^3 CFU/m2). The PMA-qPCR analysis showed considerable variation of viable bacterial population (10^5 to 10^9 16S rDNA gene copies/m2) among locations sampled. Unlike contact slides, polyester wipes cover much larger sample surface (~1 m2) and produce much more reliable results of the microbial diversity of the ISS covering both cultivable and non-cultivable species. The cultivable, total, and viable microbial diversity was determined utilizing state-of-the art molecular techniques. The implementation of the PMA assay before DNA extraction allowed distinguishing viable microorganisms, which is crucial for determining their role to the crew health, the ISS maintenance and the general knowledge of the closed environmentally controlled built systems. </description>"
"<description> Microgravity or an altered gravity environment from the static 1g has been shown to influence global gene expression patterns and protein levels in cultured cells or animals, but it is unclear how these changes in gene and protein expressions are related to each other or are related to other factors regulating such changes. Recent advancement in the field of molecular biology revealed that a different class of RNA, the small non-coding microRNA (miRNA), can have a broad effect on gene expression networks by mainly inhibiting the translational process. In this experiment conducted on the International Space Station, we propose to test the hypotheses that miRNA profiles will be altered in the space environment, and that cellular responses to DNA damage in space are different from those on the ground. </description>"

"<description> Background: The radiation bystander response is an important component of the overall response of cells to radiation and critical to understanding health risks of radiation exposure to humans. The mechanism of radiation response includes inter-cellular signaling and intra-cellular communication by which the bystander signal is propagated. Methods: We measured the bystander response to 1Gy a-particle radiation in Mrad9-/- mouse stem cells and H1299shRAD9 cells, using chromosomal aberration and micronucleus formation as DNA damage endpoints. In the H1299 model we used whole genome microarray analyses to profile the transcriptome of irradiated and bystander cells. Results: We investigated the role of RAD9 in the bystander response and showed that depletion or mutation of RAD9 had an effect of increasing chromosomal structural damage as well as micronucleus formation in bystander cells. The enhancement of the damage effect correlated strongly with a transcriptomic response in critical pathways. RAD9 depletion affected many pathways in the cell, including the UV-MAPK pathway, involving p38MAPK members, STAT1 and PARP1 at the mRNA levels. There was an overall reduction of RNA biogenesis of gene members of this pathway suggesting that perhaps these signaling pathways do not function optimally after RAD9 depletion. Using network analysis we found there may be differential activation of transcriptional regulators between the irradiated and bystander cells involving the SP1 and NUPR1 transcription factors. Network analysis also suggested that HIF1a (Hypoxia induced factor 1a) activation could be a negative predictor of the bystander effect and perhaps that local hypoxic stress observed by cells that are directly exposed to radiation may predict whether or not they will elicit a bystander response. Gene expression in H1299 cells was measured at 4 hours after exposure to 1 Gy a-particles. There were two groups based on RAD9 status, RAD9 normal and RAD9 depleted by siRNA. In each of these groups, sham irradiated, direct irradiated cells for positive bystanders, positive bystanders, direct irradiated cells for negative bystanders and negative bystanders; were identified based on micronucleus responses. Five biological replicates were analyzed for each experimental group. </description>"
"<description> Genomic and proteomic characterization of the Aspergillus niger isolate, JSC-093350089, collected from U.S. segment surfaces of the International Space Station (ISS) is reported, along with a comparison to the experimentally established strain ATCC 1015.

"<description> DLD-1 and MOLT-4 cell lines were cultured in a rotating cell culture system to simulate microgravity and mRNA expression profile in comparison to Static controls. Cells were grown in 10mL rotating vessels in a Rotary Cell Culture System (RCCS) and in 60mm Petri dishes (test, control respectively). Two replicates of test (Microgravity) and control (static), each from DLD-1 and MOLT-4 were analyzed by microarray. Simulated microgravity affected the solid tumor cell line DLD-1 markedly which showed a higher percentage of dysregulated genes compared to the hematological tumor cell line, MOLT-4. Microgravity affects the cell cycle of DLD-1 cells and disturbs expression of cell cycle regulatory gene networks. Multiple microRNA host genes were dysregulated and significantly, mir-22, tumor suppressor microRNA, is highly upregulated in DLD-1. </description>"

"<description> We differentiated mouse bone marrow cells in the presence of recombinant macrophage colony stimulating (rM-CSF) factor for 14 days during the flight of space shuttle Space Transportation System (STS)-126. We tested the hypothesis that the receptor expression for M-CSF, c-Fms was reduced. We used flow cytometry to assess molecules on cells that were preserved during flight to define the differentiation state of the developing bone marrow macrophages; including CD11b, CD31, CD44, Ly6C, Ly6G, F4/80, Mac2, c-Fos as well as c-Fms. In addition, RNA was preserved during the flight and was used to perform a gene microarray. We found that there were significant differences in the number of macrophages that developed in space compared to controls maintained on Earth. We found that there were significant changes in the distribution of cells that expressed CD11b, CD31, F4/80, Mac2, Ly6C and c-Fos. However, there were no changes in c-Fms expression and no consistent pattern of advanced or retarded differentiation during space flight. We also found a pattern of transcript levels that would be consistent with a relatively normal differentiation outcome but increased proliferation by the bone marrow macrophages that were assayed after 14 days of space flight. There also was a surprising pattern of space flight influence on genes of the coagulation pathway. These data confirm that a space flight can have an impact on the in vitro development of macrophages from mouse bone marrow cells. </description>"

"<description> The BRIC-21 mission was designed to identify the response of Bacillus subtilis to the human spaceflight environment. For this mission, samples were grown in rich-medium using the Biological Research in Canister Petri Dish Fixation Units (BRIC-PDFU) spaceflight hardware. B. subtilis spores were inoculated during spaceflight, grown at the ambient ISS temperature, and frozen in the onboard -80 C freezer prior to returning to Earth. RNA was extracted from samples grown onboard the International Space Station (ISS) and matching Ground Controls for transcriptome analysis. </description>"
"<description> Astronauts are exposed to a unique combination of stressors during spaceflight, which leads to alterations in their physiology and potentially increases their susceptibility to infectious pathogens. Here we report the first microarray evaluation of any astronaut tissue sample, specifically whole blood, before and after spaceflight using an array comprising 234 well-characterized stress response genes. Differentially regulated genes included those important for DNA repair, oxidative stress, and protein folding/degradation. Microarrays comprising 234 well characterized stress-related genes were used to profile transcriptomic changes in six astronauts before and after short-duration spaceflight. Blood samples were collected for analysis from each eastronaut 10 days prior and 2-3 hours after return from spaceflight. Data submitted for platform GPL140 contain genes that have been pre-filtered by the analytical software to remove values of low certainty, resulting in missing values for some samples. Unfortunately, these original data are no longer available due to physical damage at Tulane University during hurricane Katrina, but the processed values were retained in redundant locations and these are submitted for upload to GEO. </description>"
"<description> Accumulating data support the concept that ionizing radiation therapy (RT) has the potential to convert the tumor into an in situ, individualized vaccine; however this potential is rarely realized by RT alone. Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) is an immunosuppressive cytokine that is activated by RT and inhibits the antigen-presenting function of dendritic cells and the differentiation of effector CD8+ T cells. Here we tested the hypothesis that TGFβ hinders the ability of RT to promote anti-tumor immunity. Development of tumor-specific immunity was examined in a pre-clinical model of metastatic breast cancer. Mice bearing established 4T1 mouse mammary carcinoma treated with pan-isoform specific TGFβ neutralizing antibody, 1D11, showed significantly improved control of the irradiated tumor and non-irradiated metastases, but no effect in the absence of RT. Notably, whole tumor transcriptional analysis demonstrated the selective upregulation of genes associated with immune-mediated rejection only in tumors of mice treated with RT+TGFβ blockade. Mice treated with RT+TGFβ blockade exhibited cross-priming of CD8+ T cells producing IFNγ in response to three tumor-specific antigens in tumor-draining lymph nodes, which was not evident for single modality treatment. Analysis of the immune infiltrate in mouse tumors showed a significant increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells only in mice treated with the combination of RT+TGFβ blockade. Depletion of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells abrogated the therapeutic benefit of RT+TGFβ blockade. These data identify TGFβ as a master inhibitor of the ability of RT to generate an in situ tumor vaccine, which supports testing inhibition of TGFβ during radiotherapy to promote therapeutically effective anti-tumor immunity. We used genome-wide microarray to depict main biological processes responsibles for the therapeutic benefit of the combination ofTGF-beta blockade and local radiotherapy. To gain a more comprehensice protrait of the effects of RT and TGFbeta blockade on gene expressionin tumors, we collected 4T1 tumors 4 days after completion of RT. Three tumors from each group were then subjected to RNA extraction and hybridization on affymetrix array. </description>"
"<description> Bacterial behavior has been observed to change during spaceflight. Higher final cell counts, enhanced biofilm formation, increased virulence, and reduced susceptibility to antibiotics have been reported to occur for cells cultured in space . Most of these phenomena are theorized as being an indirect effect of an altered extracellular environment, where the carbon source uptake is inhibited and excreted acidic byproducts buildup around the cell due to the lack of gravity-driven transport forces. However, to date neither spaceflight results, ground-based studies, physical measurement techniques nor computational approaches have provided sufficient evidence needed to confirm this model. Gene expression data from the Antibiotic Effectiveness in Space (AES-1) experiment, however, have now allowed us to look into the biomolecular processes behind these observations and showed a systematic activation of glucose starvation and acid resistance genes. These results corroborate the reduced mass transport model proposed to govern bacterial responses to spaceflight. Furthermore, the gene expression data suggests that metabolism was stimulated in space, which could play a role in causing the observed increase in bacterial cell concentrations in microgravity. Similarly, the decrease in extracellular pH may also be involved with the reported increase in virulence in space. </description>"
"<description> The objective of the Rodent Research-6 (RR-6) study was to evaluate muscle atrophy in mice during spaceflight and to test the efficacy of a novel therapeutic to mitigate muscle wasting. The experiment involved an implantable subcutaneous nanochannel delivery system (nDS; between scapula), which delivered the drug formoterol (FMT; a selective Beta-2 adrenoceptor agonist), over the course of time. To this end, a cohort of forty 32-weeks-old female C57BL/6NTac mice were either sham operated or implanted with vehicle or treatment-filled nDS, launched in two Transporters (20 mice per Transporter) on SpaceX-13 on December 15, 2017. They were transferred to Rodent Habitats onboard the International Space Station (ISS), and maintained in microgravity for 29 days (N=20, Live Animal Return [LAR]), or >50 days (N=20, ISS Terminal). After 29 days, the 20 LAR animals were returned live to back to Earth on January 13, 2018,. After splashdown, the animals were ambulatory on-ground for ~4 days, until all subjects were processed during one day of dissections. There were two Baseline groups of animals sacrificed (LAR Baseline & FLT Baseline; N=20; 40 animals; ~36 weeks old) at Kennedy Space Center (KSC; 12/9/17). A Ground Control group mimicked the Flight LAR group, which was housed at KSC, then shipped alive, to Novartis' Facilities, where both the LAR and LAR Ground Control groups were processed (~41 weeks old; 1/16/18). All were anesthetized with isoflurane, blood samples were obtained by closed-chest cardiac puncture, and the animals were euthanized by exsanguination and thoracotomy. The 20 ISS Terminal mice were anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine over the course of a four days of dissections (2/6/18 until 2/9/18; 53-56 days after launch; 44 weeks old at time of on-orbit dissections). Blood samples and euthanasia were conducted the same as LAR and Baseline. Following blood draw and hind limb dissection, the ISS-terminal animal carcasses were wrapped in aluminum foil, placed in a ziploc bag and placed in storage at -80C or colder until return. The ISS-terminal Ground Controls (at KSC) followed the same euthanasia timeline, methods, and preservation. The final processing of frozen ISS-terminal, frozen ISS-terminal Ground Controls and frozen 0-day FLT baseline animals were completed at Houston Methodist Research Institute, in Houston, TX (5/21/18 until 5/24/18). GeneLab received samples of lung from only sham treated animals (no drug treated animals) from the following groups Flight: LAR (n=10), ISS Terminal (n= 10); Ground Controls: LAR GC (N=9), ISS Terminal GC (N=10), LAR Baseline (n=10) ISS Terminal Baseline (n=9). Total RNA was extracted and sequenced at a target depth of 60 M clusters per sample (ribodepleted, paired end 150). </description>"

"<description> The vestibular system receives a permanent influence from gravity and reflexively controls equilibrium. If we assume gravity has remained constant during the species' evolution, will its sensory system adapt to abrupt loss of that force? We address this question in the land snail Helix lucorum exposed to 30 days of near weightlessness aboard the Bion-M1 satellite, and studied geotactic behavior of postflight snails, differential gene expressions in statocyst transcriptome, and electrophysiological responses of mechanoreceptors to applied tilts. Each approach revealed plastic changes in the snail's vestibular system assumed in response to spaceflight. Absence of light during the mission also affected statocyst physiology, as revealed by comparison to dark-conditioned control groups. Readaptation to normal tilt responses occurred at ~20 h following return to Earth. Despite the permanence of gravity, the snail responded in a compensatory manner to its loss and readapted once gravity was restored. </description>"

"<description> Spaceflight imposes the risk of skeletal muscle atrophy for astronauts. The understanding of muscle atrophy because of spaceflight is limited, but continued efforts are essential for developing countermeasures of this effect. A distinct difference between spaceflight-induced muscle atrophy and other forms of atrophy is the additional effect of cosmic rays in outer space. To study spaceflight-induced muscle atrophy, we performed two ground-based models of microgravity in a low dose radiation environment and studied transcriptional changes in rat soleus muscle using microarray technology. </description>"
"<description> R. rubrum S1H inoculated on solid minimal media was sent to the ISS in September 2006 (BASE-A experiment). After 10 days flight, R. rubrum cultures returned back to Earth. These cultures were then subjected to both transcriptomic and proteomic analysis and compared with the corresponding ground control. Whole-genome oligonucleotide microarray and high throughput proteomics, which offer the possibility to survey respectively the global transcriptional and translational response of an organism, were used to test the effect of space flight. Moreover, in an effort to identify a specific stress response of R. rubrum to space flight, ground simulation of space ionizing radiation and space gravity were performed under identical culture setup and growth conditions encountered during the actual space journey. This study is unique in combining the results from an actual space experiment with the corresponding space ionizing radiation and modeled microgravity ground simulations, which lead to a more solid dissection of the different factors contribution acting in space flight conditions. Total RNA was extracted from R. rubrum S1H grown after 10 days in space flight or after 10 days in simulated ionizing radiation or simulated microgravity. Each microarray slide contained 3 technical repeats. </description>"
